<s>[INST] arture from Twitter — focusing on a tweet Musk wrote that wrongly accused him of pedophilia — and how that forced him to leave his home and fear for his safety.

He also questioned Twitter/X’s claims that hate speech had dramatically declined at the company under Musk’s ownership, and warned Yaccarino that she could one day face Musk’s wrath: “Look at what your boss did to me,” he said, when Swisher asked him to offer advice to Yaccarino. “It happened to me. It happened after he sung my praises publicly.”

Apologies for the long meta-backstory. (While we are at it, I’ll disclose that I conducted two interviews at Code this year but wasn’t involved in any other speaker bookings.) But you need it to understand the set-up for the combative tone Yaccarino brought to the stage. It’s also a little embarrassing for a writer to write this but: You’ll want to watch the video of this to get the whole gestalt. Here you go:


The reason any of this matters is that Yaccarino, a veteran TV advertising executive, long accustomed to making persuasive pitches on behalf of her clients, is now trying to do the same for Musk. But convincing the world that Elon Musk — or at least the version of Elon Musk who owns Twitter — is someone they should invest in, financially, emotionally, and otherwise, is a much different task than getting them to buy NBC’s fall TV line-up. And Wednesday’s appearance suggests just how different that task will be. In Yaccarino’s previous life, for starters, she’s never had to represent someone who is feuding with a Jewish anti-hate group.


On to the substance of the interview: You may be under the impression, in part because of reporting about the company and in part because of Musk’s own commentary on his platform, that since Musk bought Twitter, users and advertisers have fled and that the site has seen a spike in hateful content. You may also believe that, although Musk hired Yaccarino to be CEO of the company — a move he essentially leaked while she was preparing to give a major advertising presentation at NBCUniversal, her last employer, and before she had told NBCU execs about her plans — it’s not a real CEO job because Musk still controls major parts of the company. And also because Musk doesn’t seem capable of restraining himself from tweeting things like his belief that the Anti-Defamation League has a vendetta against him.

None of these things are true, Yaccarino explained to interviewer Julia Boorstin of CNBC at the Code conference. Some excerpts from her interview:

On the health of Twitter’s platform under Musk: She repeated earlier claims that the company now has more than 540 million users — more than double than the user base Musk cited last November. “When you look at the length of time spent, engagement on X, the key metrics are trending very, very positively,” she said.

On Twitter’s financial status: While Musk has previously said more than 60 percent of Twitter’s US advertising had vanished since he bought the company, Yaccarino said large and small advertisers are now returning since she arrived on the job. “Why are they returning? They are returning because of the power and significance of the platform,” she said.

Yaccarino also said that contrary to Musk’s previous suggestions that Twitter was in danger of bankruptcy, things had bounced back. “From an operating cash flow perspective, we are just about break-even,” she said, and projected that the company would be profitable early next year.

On Yaccarino’s position in the company and in Musk’s eyes: She said that she and Musk “talk about everything,” including his recently floated plan to convert Twitter from a free service to one that would require all users to pay, and that it was only right for him to tweet the way he’d like. “The foundation of X is based on free expression and freedom of speech,” Yaccarino explained. “Everyone has the opportunity to speak their opinion. Including Elon.”


Yaccarino also dismissed the idea that her power was diminished by Musk’s control of the tech company’s product. “Who wouldn’t want Elon Musk sitting by their side running product?” she asked the audience.

And in reference to Musk’s erratic nature and tendency to slip into “demon mode” — a phrase that surfaced in the new Musk biography by Walter Isaacson — she said she has yet to see that. “When you get inspired and pushed by Elon Musk, you do the things that you’d think were never normally possible,” she said. “I’ve been there 12 weeks. I am still somewhat in awe of his availability to me.”

On Twitter prior to Musk’s ownership: Yaccarino, like Musk, said that while she liked Twitter and had previously partnered with the company when she ran advertising at NBCUniversal, it was a deeply flawed company. “Twitter at the time was operating on a different set of rules ... different philosophies and different ideologies, [it was] creeping down the road of censorship,” she said. Musk’s new company, she repeated a few times, “is a new company, building a foundation based on free expression and free speech.”

Again, you’ll want to watch the video above for this one. It’s quite something.

Does any of this matter when it comes to the future of Twitter under Musk, and Yaccarino’s tenure there? There’s no way of knowing. Yaccarino has deep ties with the advertising business, and there are still many people in the industry hoping she can return Twitter to something they can spend (some) money on. Maybe that will happen. Note, for example, this recent public hug from the head of the NFL’s media operation, a very important Twitter partner:


But watching Yaccarino’s appearance onstage also reminded me of the Trump administration, when members of Trump’s circle would go on TV knowing that their primary mission was to please the president, who was famously glued to TV news. If Elon Musk sees Wednesday’s event, he’ll see, at a minimum, that his CEO is happy to share her displeasure with a media company in a public forum. Maybe he’ll like that?

FlashAttention
Figure 1: Left: FlashAttention uses tiling to prevent materialization of the large 𝑁 × 𝑁 attention matrix (dotted box) on (relatively) slow GPU HBM. In the outer loop (red arrows), FlashAttention loops through blocks of the K and V matrices and loads them to fast on-chip SRAM. In each block, FlashAttention loops over blocks of Q matrix (blue arrows), loading them to SRAM, and writing the output of the attention
computation back to HBM. Right: Speedup over the PyTorch implementation of attention on GPT-2. FlashAttention does not read and write the large 𝑁 × 𝑁 attention matrix to HBM, resulting in an 7.6× speedup on the attention computation.
GPUs, compute speed has out-paced memory speed [61, 62, 63], and most operations in Transformers are bottlenecked by memory accesses [43]. IO-aware algorithms have been critical for similar memory-bound operations, when reading and writing data can account for a large portion of the runtime—such as database joins [71], image processing [70], numerical linear algebra [4], and more [40, 85]. However, common Python interfaces to deep learning such as PyTorch and Tensorflow do not allow fine-grained control of memory access.
We propose FlashAttention, a new attention algorithm that computes exact attention with far fewer memory accesses. Our main goal is to avoid reading and writing the attention matrix to and from HBM. This requires (i) computing the softmax reduction without access to the whole input (ii) not storing the large intermediate attention matrix for the backward pass. We apply two well-established techniques to address these challenges. (i) We restructure the attention computation to split the input into blocks and make several passes over input blocks, thus incrementally performing the softmax reduction (also known as tiling). (ii) We store the softmax normalization factor from the forward pass to quickly recompute attention on-chip in the backward pass, which is faster than the standard approach of reading the intermediate attention matrix from HBM. We implement FlashAttention in CUDA to achieve fine-grained control over memory access and fuse all the attention operations into one GPU kernel. Even with the increased FLOPs due to recomputation, our algorithm both runs faster (up to 7.6x on GPT-2 [67], Figure 1 right) and uses less memory—linear in sequence length—than standard attention, thanks to the massively reduced amount of HBM access.
We analyze the IO complexity [1] of FlashAttention, proving that it requires 𝑂(𝑁2𝑑2𝑀−1) HBM accesses where 𝑑 is the head dimension and 𝑀 is the size of SRAM, as compared to Ω(𝑁𝑑 + 𝑁2) of standard attention. For typical values of 𝑑 and 𝑀, FlashAttention requires many times fewer HBM accesses compared to standard attention (up to 9× fewer, as shown in Fig. 2). Moreover, we provide a lower bound, showing that no exact attention algorithm can asymptotically improve on the number of HBM accesses over all SRAM sizes.
We also show that FlashAttention can serve as a useful primitive for realizing the potential of approximate attention algorithms by overcoming their issues with memory access overhead. As a proof of concept, we implement block-sparse FlashAttention, a sparse attention algorithm that is 2-4× faster than even FlashAttention, scaling up to sequence length of 64k. We prove that block-sparse FlashAttention has better IO complexity than FlashAttention by a factor proportional to the sparsity ratio. We discuss further extensions to other operations (attention on multi-GPU, kernel regression, block-sparse matrix

multiply) in Section 5. We open-source FlashAttention to make it easier to build on this primitive.1
We empirically validate that FlashAttention speeds up model training and improves model quality by modeling longer context. We also benchmark the runtime and memory footprint of FlashAttention and
block-sparse FlashAttention compared to prior attention implementations.
• Faster Model Training. FlashAttention trains Transformer models faster in wall-clock time. We
train BERT-large (seq. length 512) 15% faster than the training speed record in MLPerf 1.1 [58], GPT2 (seq. length 1K) 3× faster than baseline implementations from HuggingFace [87] and Megatron-LM [77],
and long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K) 2.4× faster than baselines.
• Higher Quality Models. FlashAttention scales Transformers to longer sequences, which improves their quality and enables new capabilities. We observe a 0.7 improvement in perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift from modeling longer sequences on long-document classification [13]. FlashAttention enables the first Transformer that can achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X [80] challenge, solely from using a longer sequence length (16K). Block-sparse FlashAttention enables a Transformer to scale to even longer sequences (64K), resulting in the first model that can achieve better-than-chance performance on Path-256.
• Benchmarking Attention. FlashAttention is up to 3× faster than the standard attention implemen- tation across common sequence lengths from 128 to 2K and scales up to 64K. Up to sequence length of 512, FlashAttention is both faster and more memory-efficient than any existing attention method, whereas for sequence length beyond 1K, some approximate attention methods (e.g., Linformer) start to become faster. On the other hand, block-sparse FlashAttention is faster than all existing approximate attention methods that we know of.'"   [/INST] The passage you provided discusses a research paper titled "FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness." This paper introduces a novel attention algorithm called FlashAttention, which is designed to address the computational and memory challenges faced by Transformers when dealing with long sequences.

Here are the key points from the passage:

1. **Problem with Transformers on Long Sequences**: Transformers, which are widely used in natural language processing and image classification, face computational and memory challenges when processing long sequences. The self-attention mechanism in Transformers has quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to sequence length.

2. **Approximate Attention Methods**: Prior research has explored various approximate attention methods to reduce the computational and memory requirements of attention mechanisms. However, many of these methods did not result in significant speedup in practice.

3. **IO-Aware Attention**: The authors argue that a missing principle in addressing these challenges is making attention algorithms "IO-aware." This means considering the reads and writes between different levels of memory, such as GPU on-chip SRAM and GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM).

4. **FlashAttention**: The paper introduces FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm. It uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads and writes between GPU HBM and GPU on-chip SRAM. This design minimizes the need to read and write the attention matrix to and from HBM.

5. **Performance Improvement**: FlashAttention is shown to outperform existing attention mechanisms in terms of both speed and memory efficiency. It achieves significant speedup in training Transformer models compared to existing baselines, particularly on long sequences.

6. **Applications**: FlashAttention enables Transformer models to process longer sequences, leading to higher model quality and the ability to tackle tasks that require longer context, such as document classification.

7. **Benchmarking**: The paper provides benchmarks demonstrating the performance advantages of FlashAttention compared to standard attention implementations and other approximate attention methods across various sequence lengths.

8. **Open-Source Implementation**: The authors have open-sourced FlashAttention, making it available for others to use and build upon.

In summary, FlashAttention is an innovative attention algorithm designed to accelerate training and improve the efficiency of Transformer models, particularly when dealing with long sequences. It achieves this by minimizing memory access overhead and optimizing attention computations. <s>

memory beyond inputs and output.
""   [/INST] The algorithm described in the passage is FlashAttention, which is designed to efficiently compute exact attention in deep learning models, particularly Transformers, while minimizing memory usage and HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) accesses. Let's break down the key components and techniques used in the algorithm:

1. **GPU Memory Hierarchy**: The algorithm is designed to work on GPUs, which have a memory hierarchy consisting of various types of memory with different sizes and speeds. This hierarchy includes high bandwidth memory (HBM), which is relatively slower but has a larger capacity, and on-chip SRAM, which is much faster but has limited capacity. The algorithm leverages this memory hierarchy to optimize memory access.

2. **Execution Model**: GPUs execute operations in parallel using a massive number of threads, which are organized into kernels. Each kernel loads data from HBM into registers and SRAM, performs computations, and writes results back to HBM. Understanding this execution model is crucial for optimizing memory access.

3. **Compute-Bound vs. Memory-Bound Operations**: Operations in deep learning can be classified as compute-bound or memory-bound. Compute-bound operations are primarily limited by the number of arithmetic operations, while memory-bound operations are limited by the number of memory accesses. The algorithm focuses on optimizing memory-bound operations.

4. **Kernel Fusion**: Kernel fusion is a technique that combines multiple operations applied to the same input into a single operation. It reduces the need to load the input data multiple times from HBM, which can be particularly beneficial for memory-bound operations. The algorithm leverages kernel fusion to improve efficiency.

5. **Standard Attention Implementation**: The algorithm starts by describing the standard attention implementation, which involves computing the attention output (denoted as O) from input sequences Q, K, and V. However, this standard approach materializes large intermediate matrices (S and P) to HBM, resulting in high memory usage and slow performance, especially for large sequences.

6. **FlashAttention**: FlashAttention is introduced as an efficient alternative to the standard attention implementation. It aims to reduce HBM accesses and memory usage. The key techniques used in FlashAttention are tiling and recomputation.

    - **Tiling**: FlashAttention divides input sequences (Q, K, V) into blocks and computes attention separately for each block. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be read from HBM. The softmax function is computed row-wise for each block, and the results are combined to obtain the final attention output.

    - **Recomputation**: FlashAttention avoids storing intermediate values (such as S and P) in HBM for the backward pass. Instead, it stores the output (O) and softmax normalization statistics. During the backward pass, it recomputes the necessary values from blocks of Q, K, and V in SRAM. This approach reduces memory usage and speeds up the backward pass.

7. **Implementation Details**: The algorithm provides details on how FlashAttention is implemented efficiently using a single CUDA kernel. It loads data from HBM, performs computations (including matrix multiplication and softmax), applies masking and dropout, and writes the result back to HBM. This approach minimizes the need for repeated data transfers between HBM and SRAM.

8. **Theorem**: The passage concludes with a theorem that demonstrates the correctness, runtime, and memory requirements of FlashAttention. It states that FlashAttention returns the correct attention output with a specific number of FLOPs (floating-point operations) and minimal additional memory usage beyond the input and output.

In summary, FlashAttention is an efficient attention algorithm designed to optimize memory usage and reduce HBM accesses, particularly for memory-bound operations in deep learning models like Transformers. It achieves this by using tiling and recomputation techniques while minimizing the need for intermediate data storage in HBM. <s>

Modern accelerator hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, are often memory constrained for applications in deep learning, while compute is relatively cheap. So the space complexity of transformers is a particular concern, c.f. Kitaev et al. (2020); Roy et al. (2021); Zaheer et al. (2020).
In this work, we present new algorithms for attention and self-attention that require only constant memory and loga- rithmic memory, respectively. The basic algorithm is very simple; but it requires a trick to make it numerically feasible (see Section 3).√We also present an implementation in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), which runs efficiently on TPUs, and requires O( n) memory for self-attention (see Section 4).
Unlike other works that aim to reduce the memory complexity of attention, the memory-efficient algorithm for atten- tion that we suggest is not an approximation, but computes the same function. We can hence use the memory-efficient

 algorithm as a drop-in replacement for other attention implementations to save memory. This may allow us to re- consider architecture choices, or scale to new datasets that require longer, dense attention. However, our algorithm still requires O(n2) time complexity for self-attention and O(n) time complexity for single-query attention, and the various efficient, long-context attention mechanisms remain an interesting alternative to (dense) attention.
2 Algorithm
First, we present the algorithm for the attention operation with Pa single query and extend the algorithm to self-attention at the end of this Section. We observe that the division by j esj can be moved to the very end of the attention
operation using the distributive law:
′ si si = dot(q,ki), si = e ,
P vis′i i
attention(q,k,v) = P s′ . (1) jj
 After publishing our initial draft, we were made aware that (1) is a rediscovery of the “lazy softmax" method of Jang et al. (2019, equation 4). Unfortunately their paper went in a different direction and did not discuss the memory complexity implications and other innovations we present in the remainder of this paper. For more details see Section 6.
This can be computed with constant memory: The memory overhead of this algorithm consists of a vector v∗ ∈ Rd and a scalar s∗ ∈ R, both initialized with 0. Given the query q, keys k1,...,kn and values v1,...,vn, we process the keys and values in sequence. Given a key value pair ki, vi, we compute si = dot(q, ki) and update v∗ ← v∗ + viesi and s∗ ← s∗ + esi . After processing all keys and values, we divide v∗ to get the final result.
s∗
The analysis of space complexity assumes that inputs are given in a particular order: we first read the query, and then a list of pairs of keys and values. If the inputs are provided in a different order, we have to additionally store an index into the sequence, requiring O(log n) memory instead.
To extend this algorithm to self-attention, we compute the results to all queries sequentially. This requires just one additional index into the list of queries, giving rise to the O(log n) memory complexity. Note that the operation produces outputs that are linear in the size of the number of queries, i.e., O(n), which is not counted towards the space complexity.
3 Numerical Stability
The formulation of standard attention that we presented in the Introduction, as well as our memory-efficient algorithm, are not numerically stable when using floating point arithmetic, because the softmax exponentiates the scores. For scores ≥ 89 the exponentiation results in inf (for bfloat16 and float32), which will be carried through to the final result of the attention operation. In practice, the softmax is implemented by subtracting the maximum score from all scores. This does not change the result of the softmax, but avoids this numerical problem.
Our incremental computation of the sum of exponentiated scores (and the values times the scores) does not immedi- ately allow for the same trick, as the maximum may depend on the last score in the sequence. But the subtraction cannot be delayed either, since the scores must be exponentiated before they can be added to the cumulative sum.
To resolve this problem, we introduce an additional scalar, which keeps track of the maximum score that the incre- mental algorithm has seen so far, and we renormalize the sums of exponentiated values as needed: We initialize the vector v∗ ∈ Rd and scalar s∗ ∈ R with 0, and m∗ with −inf. As before, given a key value pair ki, vi, we compute si = dot(q,ki), but then the algorithm differs slightly from Section 2. We first compute mi = max(m∗,si) and update v∗ ← v∗em∗−mi + viesi−mi and s∗ ← s∗em∗−mi + esi−mi and m∗ ← mi. After processing all keys and queries, we divide v∗ to get the final result.

4 An Implementation For TPUs
In this section, we provide a version of the algorithm above that exploits the massive parallelism of modern hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs. The naive algorithm above is is not trivial to parallelize for a compiler, as the incremental sum introduces a dependency across all keys and values.
We present the entire implementation, including the support for multiple attention heads and memory-efficient differ- entiation in Figure 1. The implementation does not optimize strictly for memory efficiency, but instead aims to strike a balance between simplicity, computational efficiency, and memory requirements.""   [/INST] The passage describes a novel algorithm for attention and self-attention in neural networks, particularly in the context of the Transformer architecture used in natural language processing and other research areas. This algorithm is designed to significantly reduce memory requirements compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms, which are often considered memory-intensive.

Here's a breakdown of the key points in the passage:

1. **Introduction to Attention**: Attention mechanisms are crucial components in modern neural architectures, including the Transformer. They are used to weigh and combine information from a sequence of keys and values based on a query.

2. **Memory and Time Complexity**: The standard implementation of attention has a time and memory complexity of O(n^2), where n is the sequence length. This quadratic complexity has motivated research into alternative attention mechanisms with more favorable complexity characteristics.

3. **Memory-Efficient Algorithm**: The passage introduces a memory-efficient algorithm for attention and self-attention. The key innovation is to achieve O(1) memory for single-query attention and O(log n) memory for self-attention, significantly reducing memory requirements.

4. **Algorithm Overview**: The memory-efficient algorithm is presented. It simplifies the computation of attention scores by moving the division operation to the end of the attention calculation. This approach requires minimal additional memory beyond a vector and a scalar, making it highly memory-efficient.

5. **Numerical Stability**: The passage addresses numerical stability issues associated with the softmax function used in attention calculations. It explains how the algorithm ensures stability by subtracting the maximum score from all scores.

6. **Implementation for TPUs**: The passage discusses an implementation of the algorithm designed to harness the parallelism of modern hardware like GPUs and TPUs. It emphasizes that while the implementation aims for computational efficiency, it also balances simplicity and memory requirements.

7. **Practical Applications**: The algorithm is not just a theoretical concept but can be practically applied as a drop-in replacement for traditional attention mechanisms. This could enable more extensive processing of longer sequences, potentially impacting architecture choices and dataset scalability.

8. **Conclusion**: The passage concludes by emphasizing that the memory-efficient algorithm computes the same function as traditional attention mechanisms. It also notes that there are other efficient attention mechanisms for handling long-context scenarios.

In summary, the passage introduces a memory-efficient algorithm for attention and self-attention, which has the potential to significantly reduce memory requirements while maintaining the correctness of computations. This innovation is particularly relevant in deep learning applications where memory constraints are a significant concern. <s>
