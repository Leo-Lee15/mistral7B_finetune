Yaccarino has deep ties with the advertising business, and there are still many people in the industry hoping she can return Twitter to something they can spend (some) money on. Maybe that will happen. Note, for example, this recent public hug from the head of the NFL\u2019s media operation, a very important Twitter partner:\n\n\nBut watching Yaccarino\u2019s appearance onstage also reminded me of the Trump administration, when members of Trump\u2019s circle would go on TV knowing that their primary mission was to please the president, who was famously glued to TV news. If Elon Musk sees Wednesday\u2019s event, he\u2019ll see, at a minimum, that his CEO is happy to share her displeasure with a media company in a public forum. Maybe he\u2019ll like that? Not at Elon Musk, the man who hired her to be the CEO of Twitter, the company he subsequently renamed X. Yaccarino says he\u2019s a brilliant leader who is turning his company into something that has more ambition than \u201cany other company likely on earth.\u201d\n\nInstead, Yaccarino is furious that my colleagues at Vox Media announced a last-minute programming update before her onstage interview at the company\u2019s Code conference: They would also host a session featuring Yoel Roth, the former head of trust and safety at Twitter who resigned shortly after Musk bought the company last year.\n\nIn his interview with Code co-founder Kara Swisher, Roth recounted the story of his departure from Twitter \u2014 focusing on a tweet Musk wrote that wrongly accused him of pedophilia \u2014 and how that forced him to leave his home and fear for his safety.\n\nHe also questioned Twitter/X\u2019s claims that hate speech had dramatically declined at the company under Musk\u2019s ownership, and warned Yaccarino that she could one day face Musk\u2019s wrath: \u201cLook at what your boss did to me,\u201d he said, when Swisher asked him to offer advice to Yaccarino. \u201cIt happened to me. It happened after he sung my praises publicly.\u201d\n\nApologies for the long meta-backstory. (While we are at it, I\u2019ll disclose that I conducted two interviews at Code this year but wasn\u2019t involved in any other speaker bookings.) But you need it to understand the set-up for the combative tone Yaccarino brought to the stage. It\u2019s also a little embarrassing for a writer to write this but: You\u2019ll want to watch the video of this to get the whole gestalt. Here you go:\n\n\nThe reason any of this matters is that Yaccarino, a veteran TV advertising executive, long accustomed to making persuasive pitches on behalf of her clients, is now trying to do the same for Musk. But convincing the world that Elon Musk \u2014 or at least the version of Elon Musk who owns Twitter \u2014 is someone they should invest in, financially, emotionally, and otherwise, is a much different task than getting them to buy NBC\u2019s fall TV line-up. And Wednesday\u2019s appearance suggests just how different that task will be. In Yaccarino\u2019s previous life, for starters, she\u2019s never had to represent someone who is feuding with a Jewish anti-hate group.\n\n\nOn to the substance of the interview: You may be under the impression, in part because of reporting about the company and in part because of Musk\u2019s own commentary on his platform, that since Musk bought Twitter, users and advertisers have fled and that the site has seen a spike in hateful content. You may also believe that, although Musk hired Yaccarino to be CEO of the company \u2014 a move he essentially leaked while she was preparing to give a major advertising presentation at NBCUniversal, her last employer, and before she had told NBCU execs about her plans \u2014 it\u2019s not a real CEO job because Musk still controls major parts of the company. And also because Musk doesn\u2019t seem capable of restraining himself from tweeting things like his belief that the Anti-Defamation League has a vendetta against him.\n\nNone of these things are true, Yaccarino explained to interviewer Julia Boorstin of CNBC at the Code conference. Some excerpts from her interview:\n\nOn the health of Twitter\u2019s platform under Musk: She repeated earlier claims that the company now has more than 540 million users \u2014 more than double than the user base Musk cited last November. \u201cWhen you look at the length of time spent, engagement on X, the key metrics are trending very, very positively,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Twitter\u2019s financial status: While Musk has previously said more than 60 percent of Twitter\u2019s US advertising had vanished since he bought the company, Yaccarino said large and small advertisers are now returning since she arrived on the job. \u201cWhy are they returning? They are returning because of the power and significance of the platform,\u201d she said.\n\nYaccarino also said that contrary to Musk\u2019s previous suggestions that Twitter was in danger of bankruptcy, things had bounced back. \u201cFrom an operating cash flow perspective, we are just about break-even,\u201d she said, and projected that the company would be profitable early next year.\n\nOn Yaccarino\u2019s position in the company and in Musk\u2019s eyes: She said that she and Musk \u201ctalk about everything,\u201d including his recently floated plan to convert Twitter from a free service to one that would require all users to pay, and that it was only right for him to tweet the way he\u2019d like. \u201cThe foundation of X is based on free expression and freedom of speech,\u201d Yaccarino explained. \u201cEveryone has the opportunity to speak their opinion. Including Elon.\u201d\n\n\nYaccarino also dismissed the idea that her power was diminished by Musk\u2019s control of the tech company\u2019s product. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want Elon Musk sitting by their side running product?\u201d she asked the audience.\n\nAnd in reference to Musk\u2019s erratic nature and tendency to slip into \u201cdemon mode\u201d \u2014 a phrase that surfaced in the new Musk biography by Walter Isaacson \u2014 she said she has yet to see that. \u201cWhen you get inspired and pushed by Elon Musk, you do the things that you\u2019d think were never normally possible,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been there 12 weeks.

She claimed that the company now has more than 540 million users, which is more than double the figure Musk cited last November. This suggests that Twitter's user engagement and reach have expanded.\n\n2. **Financial Status**: Contrary to Musk's previous comments about declining advertising revenue, Yaccarino mentioned that advertisers, both large and small, are returning to Twitter. She attributed this return to the platform's power and significance. She also stated that Twitter's financial situation had improved, with a projection of profitability in the near future.\n\n3. **Leadership and Decision-Making**: Yaccarino explained that she and Elon Musk have open communication and discuss various aspects of Twitter's direction, including Musk's idea of converting Twitter into a paid platform. She emphasized the importance of free expression and freedom of speech as the foundation of Twitter.\n\n4. **Twitter's Past Issues**: Yaccarino acknowledged that Twitter had faced challenges in the past, including issues related to censorship and content moderation. However, she portrayed Musk's Twitter as a \"new company\" focused on building a foundation based on free expression and free speech.\n\n5. **Media Relations**: The article also touches on Yaccarino's appearance at the Code conference and her public exchange with Yoel Roth, the former head of trust and safety at Twitter. This exchange highlights the challenges and controversies associated with Musk's ownership of Twitter.\n\nOverall, the article sheds light on the ongoing changes and challenges within Twitter under Elon Musk's leadership, with Linda Yaccarino playing a central role in shaping the company's future direction. It remains to be seen how these developments will impact Twitter's user base, financial performance, and its role in the broader social media landscape. what is the new direction  what is the new direction   [/INST] The article and Linda Yaccarino's comments suggest that under Elon Musk's ownership, Twitter is moving in a new direction characterized by several key elements:\n\n1. **Focus on Free Expression and Free Speech**: Yaccarino emphasized that the foundation of this \"new Twitter\" is built on principles of free expression and freedom of speech. This suggests a commitment to allowing users to express their opinions and ideas without excessive censorship.\n\n2. **User Growth**: Yaccarino claimed that Twitter has experienced significant user growth under Musk's ownership, with the user base reportedly doubling. This indicates a push to increase the platform's reach and engagement.\n\n3. **Advertiser Return**: Contrary to concerns about declining advertising revenue, Yaccarino stated that advertisers, both large and small, are returning to Twitter. This could indicate efforts to make the platform more attractive to advertisers.\n\n4. **Financial Viability**: Yaccarino mentioned that Twitter is nearing break-even from an operating cash flow perspective and is projected to be profitable in the near future. This suggests a focus on improving the financial health of the platform.\n\n5. **Leadership Collaboration**: Yaccarino and Elon Musk reportedly have ongoing discussions about the company's direction, including Musk's ideas about potentially converting Twitter into a paid platform. This collaboration indicates that decisions are being made with input from both the CEO and the owner.\n\n6. **Addressing Past Issues**: Yaccarino acknowledged that Twitter faced issues in the past, such as concerns related to censorship and content moderation.

In the outer loop (lines 54-55), we split the queries in to chunks of constant size, resulting in a linear number of iterations. In each iteration of the outer loop, we call _query_chunk_attention, which itself processes the keys and values in chunks (lines 30-31). The chunks are processed sequentially and each chunk is summarized independently (lines 12 to 19). Assuming a chunk size of \u221an for the keys and values, we hence obtain \u221an summaries, giving rise to the O(\u221an) memory complexity.\nAfter the summaries are computed, they need to be rescaled (lines 33 to 36) along the lines of Section 3, before we return the values divided by the weights (line 40). The result of each iteration of the outer loop is directly written to the output tensor res (line 54), so that no additional memory is consumed across iterations. (A multi-stage summarization approach could achieve O(log n) but would complicate the implementation.)\nWhile a constant chunk size for the queries and a chunk size of \u221an for the keys and values is optimal for memory consumption, the runtime is also affected by the choice of chunk size in practice, which is heavily affected by the choice of hardware. Ultimately, we have to leave this trade-off to the programmer, and expose the chunk sizes as arguments query_chunk_size and key_chunk_size. In Figure 1 we provide default values for the chunk sizes that lead to minimal runtime impact on TPU, while still providing significant memory savings.\n5 Empirical Analysis\n The provided code and explanation describe an implementation of a memory-efficient multi-head dot product attention mechanism suitable for modern hardware like TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). The goal is to exploit parallelism while keeping memory usage under control.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the implementation works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The code initializes some variables and parameters, such as the number of queries (`num_q`), the number of attention heads (`num_heads`), and the features for queries, keys, and values (`q_features`, `k_features`, `v_features`).\n\n2. **Chunk Processing**: To exploit parallelism, the code splits the computation into chunks. This is done for both queries and keys/values. The main idea is to divide the queries into smaller chunks (controlled by `query_chunk_size`) and process them one at a time.\n\n3. **Chunk Scanning for Queries**: An outer loop (lines 54-55) iterates over the query chunks. For each query chunk, it calls `_query_chunk_attention` (lines 30-31) to process that chunk. This is where the attention computation happens.\n\n4. **Chunk Scanning for Keys and Values**: Within `_query_chunk_attention`, keys and values are processed in chunks as well. The code slices the key and value tensors to work with manageable portions. This is crucial for memory efficiency.\n\n5. **Attention Computation**: The core attention computation is done in the `summarize_chunk` function. It calculates attention weights using dot products, applies the softmax operation, and scales values based on these weights. The `exp_weights` are calculated after softmax, and numerical stability techniques are applied to ensure reliable computation.\n\n6. **Rescaling Chunks**: After processing a chunk, the `exp_weights` and values are rescaled based on max values to prevent numerical instability (lines 33-36).\n\n7. **Aggregate Results**: The results from each chunk are aggregated to compute the final output. This is done by summing the chunk values and dividing them by the chunk weights (line 40).\n\n8. **Memory Efficiency**: The code ensures memory efficiency by processing queries, keys, and values in manageable chunks. It also makes use of parallelism to speed up computations.\n\n9. **Customizable Chunk Sizes**: The code allows users to customize the chunk sizes for queries and keys/values using `query_chunk_size` and `key_chunk_size` parameters.\n\n10. **Empirical Analysis**: The code is intended for empirical analysis, likely to compare its performance against traditional self-attention mechanisms, especially in terms of memory consumption and runtime.\n\nOverall, this implementation provides a practical way to perform memory-efficient multi-head attention calculations suitable for modern hardware, such as TPUs. It strikes a balance between memory efficiency, computational speed, and ease of use, allowing researchers and practitioners to experiment with different chunk sizes and configurations to optimize their specific use cases. write out the alg  write out the alg   [/INST] The algorithm described in the code provided can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Algorithm: Memory-Efficient Multi-Head Dot Product Attention**\n\n**Input**:\n- `query`: Query tensor of shape (num_q, num_heads, q_features).\n- `key`: Key tensor of shape (num_kv, num_heads, k_features).\n- `value`: Value tensor of shape (num_kv, num_heads, v_features).\n- `precision`: Precision level for computation (e.g., floating-point precision).\n- `query_chunk_size`: Chunk size for queries.\n\n**Output**:\n- Attention scores for the given queries.\n\n**Implementation**:\n\n1. Initialize variables:\n   - `num_kv`, `num_heads`, `k_features`, `v_features` from the shapes of key and value tensors.\n   - Initialize key chunk size (e.g., `key_chunk_size`), ensuring it does not exceed `num_kv`.\n\n2. Normalize the query tensor:\n   - Divide each value in the query tensor by the square root of `k_features`.\n\n3. Process queries in chunks:\n   - Divide the queries into smaller chunks of size `query_chunk_size`.\n   - For each query chunk, perform the following steps:\n\n   4. Chunk Scanning for Keys and Values:\n      - Split key and value tensors into chunks to match the query chunk size.\n\n   5. Attention Computation within `_query_chunk_attention`:\n      - Calculate attention weights using dot products between the chunked queries and keys.\n      - Apply the softmax operation to the attention weights to get `exp_weights`.\n      - Ensure numerical stability during softmax computation.\n      - Scale the values based on `exp_weights`.\n\n   6. Rescale Chunks:\n      - Apply max-value rescaling to `exp_weights` and values.\n\n   7. Aggregate Results:\n      - Summarize the chunked results by summing the chunk values and dividing by chunk weights.\n\n8. Return the final attention scores.\n\nThis algorithm efficiently computes multi-head dot product attention, processing queries, keys, and values in chunks to reduce memory consumption and maximize parallelism. The choice of chunk sizes (`query_chunk_size` and `key_chunk_size`) can be customized based on hardware and performance requirements. <s>"}

Modern accelerator hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, are often memory constrained for applications in deep learning, while compute is relatively cheap. So the space complexity of transformers is a particular concern, c.f. Kitaev et al. (2020); Roy et al. (2021); Zaheer et al. (2020).\nIn this work, we present new algorithms for attention and self-attention that require only constant memory and loga- rithmic memory, respectively. The basic algorithm is very simple; but it requires a trick to make it numerically feasible (see Section 3).\u221aWe also present an implementation in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), which runs efficiently on TPUs, and requires O( n) memory for self-attention (see Section 4).\nUnlike other works that aim to reduce the memory complexity of attention, the memory-efficient algorithm for atten- tion that we suggest is not an approximation, but computes the same function. We can hence use the memory-efficient\nvis\u2032i.\nThe result of the attention operation for a single query, is hence a weighted sum of the value vectors, where the weights\ni\n   arXiv:2112.05682v3 [cs.LG] 10 Oct 2022\n \nSelf-attention Does Not Need O(n2) Memory A PREPRINT\n algorithm as a drop-in replacement for other attention implementations to save memory. This may allow us to re- consider architecture choices, or scale to new datasets that require longer, dense attention. However, our algorithm still requires O(n2) time complexity for self-attention and O(n) time complexity for single-query attention, and the various efficient, long-context attention mechanisms remain an interesting alternative to (dense) attention.\n2 Algorithm\nFirst, we present the algorithm for the attention operation with Pa single query and extend the algorithm to self-attention at the end of this Section. We observe that the division by j esj can be moved to the very end of the attention\noperation using the distributive law:\n\u2032 si si = dot(q,ki), si = e ,\nP vis\u2032i i\nattention(q,k,v) = P s\u2032 . (1) jj\n After publishing our initial draft, we were made aware that (1) is a rediscovery of the \u201clazy softmax\" method of Jang et al. (2019, equation 4). Unfortunately their paper went in a different direction and did not discuss the memory complexity implications and other innovations we present in the remainder of this paper. For more details see Section 6.\nThis can be computed with constant memory: The memory overhead of this algorithm consists of a vector v\u2217 \u2208 Rd and a scalar s\u2217 \u2208 R, both initialized with 0. Given the query q, keys k1,...,kn and values v1,...,vn, we process the keys and values in sequence. Given a key value pair ki, vi, we compute si = dot(q, ki) and update v\u2217 \u2190 v\u2217 + viesi and s\u2217 \u2190 s\u2217 + esi . After processing all keys and values, we divide v\u2217 to get the final result.\ns\u2217\nThe analysis of space complexity assumes that inputs are given in a particular order: we first read the query, and then a list of pairs of keys and values. If the inputs are provided in a different order, we have to additionally store an index into the sequence, requiring O(log n) memory instead.\nTo extend this algorithm to self-attention, we compute the results to all queries sequentially. This requires just one additional index into the list of queries, giving rise to the O(log n) memory complexity. Note that the operation produces outputs that are linear in the size of the number of queries, i.e., O(n), which is not counted towards the space complexity.\n3 Numerical Stability\nThe formulation of standard attention that we presented in the Introduction, as well as our memory-efficient algorithm, are not numerically stable when using floating point arithmetic, because the softmax exponentiates the scores. For scores \u2265 89 the exponentiation results in inf (for bfloat16 and float32), which will be carried through to the final result of the attention operation. In practice, the softmax is implemented by subtracting the maximum score from all scores. This does not change the result of the softmax, but avoids this numerical problem.\nOur incremental computation of the sum of exponentiated scores (and the values times the scores) does not immedi- ately allow for the same trick, as the maximum may depend on the last score in the sequence. But the subtraction cannot be delayed either, since the scores must be exponentiated before they can be added to the cumulative sum.\nTo resolve this problem, we introduce an additional scalar, which keeps track of the maximum score that the incre- mental algorithm has seen so far, and we renormalize the sums of exponentiated values as needed: We initialize the vector v\u2217 \u2208 Rd and scalar s\u2217 \u2208 R with 0, and m\u2217 with \u2212inf. As before, given a key value pair ki, vi, we compute si = dot(q,ki), but then the algorithm differs slightly from Section 2. We first compute mi = max(m\u2217,si) and update v\u2217 \u2190 v\u2217em\u2217\u2212mi + viesi\u2212mi and s\u2217 \u2190 s\u2217em\u2217\u2212mi + esi\u2212mi and m\u2217 \u2190 mi. After processing all keys and queries, we divide v\u2217 to get the final result.\ns\u2217\n4 An Implementation For TPUs\nIn this section, we provide a version of the algorithm above that exploits the massive parallelism of modern hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs. The naive algorithm above is is not trivial to parallelize for a compiler, as the incremental sum introduces a dependency across all keys and values.\nWe present the entire implementation, including the support for multiple attention heads and memory-efficient differ- entiation in Figure 1. The implementation does not optimize strictly for memory efficiency, but instead aims to strike a balance between simplicity, computational efficiency, and memory requirements.\"\"   [/INST] The passage describes a novel algorithm for attention and self-attention in neural networks, particularly in the context of the Transformer architecture used in natural language processing and other research areas. This algorithm is designed to significantly reduce memory requirements compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms, which are often considered memory-intensive.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points in the passage:\n\n1. **Introduction to Attention**: Attention mechanisms are crucial components in modern neural architectures, including the Transformer. They are used to weigh and combine information from a sequence of keys and values based on a query.\n\n2. **Memory and Time Complexity**: The standard implementation of attention has a time and memory complexity of O(n^2), where n is the sequence length. This quadratic complexity has motivated research into alternative attention mechanisms with more favorable complexity characteristics.\n\n3. **Memory-Efficient Algorithm**: The passage introduces a memory-efficient algorithm for attention and self-attention. The key innovation is to achieve O(1) memory for single-query attention and O(log n) memory for self-attention, significantly reducing memory requirements.\n\n4. **Algorithm Overview**: The memory-efficient algorithm is presented. It simplifies the computation of attention scores by moving the division operation to the end of the attention calculation. This approach requires minimal additional memory beyond a vector and a scalar, making it highly memory-efficient.\n\n5. **Numerical Stability**: The passage addresses numerical stability issues associated with the softmax function used in attention calculations. It explains how the algorithm ensures stability by subtracting the maximum score from all scores.\n\n6. **Implementation for TPUs**: The passage discusses an implementation of the algorithm designed to harness the parallelism of modern hardware like GPUs and TPUs. It emphasizes that while the implementation aims for computational efficiency, it also balances simplicity and memory requirements.\n\n7. **Practical Applications**: The algorithm is not just a theoretical concept but can be practically applied as a drop-in replacement for traditional attention mechanisms. This could enable more extensive processing of longer sequences, potentially impacting architecture choices and dataset scalability.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: The passage concludes by emphasizing that the memory-efficient algorithm computes the same function as traditional attention mechanisms. It also notes that there are other efficient attention mechanisms for handling long-context scenarios.\n\nIn summary, the passage introduces a memory-efficient algorithm for attention and self-attention, which has the potential to significantly reduce memory requirements while maintaining the correctness of computations. This innovation is particularly relevant in deep learning applications where memory constraints are a significant concern. <s>"}

In the outer loop (lines 54-55), we split the queries in to chunks of constant size, resulting in a linear number of iterations. In each iteration of the outer loop, we call _query_chunk_attention, which itself processes the keys and values in chunks (lines 30-31). The chunks are processed sequentially and each chunk is summarized independently (lines 12 to 19). Assuming a chunk size of \u221an for the keys and values, we hence obtain \u221an summaries, giving rise to the O(\u221an) memory complexity.\nAfter the summaries are computed, they need to be rescaled (lines 33 to 36) along the lines of Section 3, before we return the values divided by the weights (line 40). The result of each iteration of the outer loop is directly written to the output tensor res (line 54), so that no additional memory is consumed across iterations. (A multi-stage summarization approach could achieve O(log n) but would complicate the implementation.)\nWhile a constant chunk size for the queries and a chunk size of \u221an for the keys and values is optimal for memory consumption, the runtime is also affected by the choice of chunk size in practice, which is heavily affected by the choice of hardware. Ultimately, we have to leave this trade-off to the programmer, and expose the chunk sizes as arguments query_chunk_size and key_chunk_size. In Figure 1 we provide default values for the chunk sizes that lead to minimal runtime impact on TPU, while still providing significant memory savings.\n5 Empirical Analysis\n  [/INST] The provided code and explanation describe an implementation of a memory-efficient multi-head dot product attention mechanism suitable for modern hardware like TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). The goal is to exploit parallelism while keeping memory usage under control.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the implementation works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The code initializes some variables and parameters, such as the number of queries (`num_q`), the number of attention heads (`num_heads`), and the features for queries, keys, and values (`q_features`, `k_features`, `v_features`).\n\n2. **Chunk Processing**: To exploit parallelism, the code splits the computation into chunks. This is done for both queries and keys/values. The main idea is to divide the queries into smaller chunks (controlled by `query_chunk_size`) and process them one at a time.\n\n3. **Chunk Scanning for Queries**: An outer loop (lines 54-55) iterates over the query chunks. For each query chunk, it calls `_query_chunk_attention` (lines 30-31) to process that chunk. This is where the attention computation happens.\n\n4. **Chunk Scanning for Keys and Values**: Within `_query_chunk_attention`, keys and values are processed in chunks as well. The code slices the key and value tensors to work with manageable portions. This is crucial for memory efficiency.\n\n5. **Attention Computation**: The core attention computation is done in the `summarize_chunk` function. It calculates attention weights using dot products, applies the softmax operation, and scales values based on these weights. The `exp_weights` are calculated after softmax, and numerical stability techniques are applied to ensure reliable computation.\n\n6. **Rescaling Chunks**: After processing a chunk, the `exp_weights` and values are rescaled based on max values to prevent numerical instability (lines 33-36).\n\n7. **Aggregate Results**: The results from each chunk are aggregated to compute the final output. This is done by summing the chunk values and dividing them by the chunk weights (line 40).\n\n8. **Memory Efficiency**: The code ensures memory efficiency by processing queries, keys, and values in manageable chunks. It also makes use of parallelism to speed up computations.\n\n9. **Customizable Chunk Sizes**: The code allows users to customize the chunk sizes for queries and keys/values using `query_chunk_size` and `key_chunk_size` parameters.\n\n10. **Empirical Analysis**: The code is intended for empirical analysis, likely to compare its performance against traditional self-attention mechanisms, especially in terms of memory consumption and runtime.\n\nOverall, this implementation provides a practical way to perform memory-efficient multi-head attention calculations suitable for modern hardware, such as TPUs. It strikes a balance between memory efficiency, computational speed, and ease of use, allowing researchers and practitioners to experiment with different chunk sizes and configurations to optimize their specific use cases. <s>"}
