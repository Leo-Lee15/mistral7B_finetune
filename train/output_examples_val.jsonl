{"text": "<s>[INST] arture from Twitter \u2014 focusing on a tweet Musk wrote that wrongly accused him of pedophilia \u2014 and how that forced him to leave his home and fear for his safety.\n\nHe also questioned Twitter/X\u2019s claims that hate speech had dramatically declined at the company under Musk\u2019s ownership, and warned Yaccarino that she could one day face Musk\u2019s wrath: \u201cLook at what your boss did to me,\u201d he said, when Swisher asked him to offer advice to Yaccarino. \u201cIt happened to me. It happened after he sung my praises publicly.\u201d\n\nApologies for the long meta-backstory. (While we are at it, I\u2019ll disclose that I conducted two interviews at Code this year but wasn\u2019t involved in any other speaker bookings.) But you need it to understand the set-up for the combative tone Yaccarino brought to the stage. It\u2019s also a little embarrassing for a writer to write this but: You\u2019ll want to watch the video of this to get the whole gestalt. Here you go:\n\n\nThe reason any of this matters is that Yaccarino, a veteran TV advertising executive, long accustomed to making persuasive pitches on behalf of her clients, is now trying to do the same for Musk. But convincing the world that Elon Musk \u2014 or at least the version of Elon Musk who owns Twitter \u2014 is someone they should invest in, financially, emotionally, and otherwise, is a much different task than getting them to buy NBC\u2019s fall TV line-up. And Wednesday\u2019s appearance suggests just how different that task will be. In Yaccarino\u2019s previous life, for starters, she\u2019s never had to represent someone who is feuding with a Jewish anti-hate group.\n\n\nOn to the substance of the interview: You may be under the impression, in part because of reporting about the company and in part because of Musk\u2019s own commentary on his platform, that since Musk bought Twitter, users and advertisers have fled and that the site has seen a spike in hateful content. You may also believe that, although Musk hired Yaccarino to be CEO of the company \u2014 a move he essentially leaked while she was preparing to give a major advertising presentation at NBCUniversal, her last employer, and before she had told NBCU execs about her plans \u2014 it\u2019s not a real CEO job because Musk still controls major parts of the company. And also because Musk doesn\u2019t seem capable of restraining himself from tweeting things like his belief that the Anti-Defamation League has a vendetta against him.\n\nNone of these things are true, Yaccarino explained to interviewer Julia Boorstin of CNBC at the Code conference. Some excerpts from her interview:\n\nOn the health of Twitter\u2019s platform under Musk: She repeated earlier claims that the company now has more than 540 million users \u2014 more than double than the user base Musk cited last November. \u201cWhen you look at the length of time spent, engagement on X, the key metrics are trending very, very positively,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Twitter\u2019s financial status: While Musk has previously said more than 60 percent of Twitter\u2019s US advertising had vanished since he bought the company, Yaccarino said large and small advertisers are now returning since she arrived on the job. \u201cWhy are they returning? They are returning because of the power and significance of the platform,\u201d she said.\n\nYaccarino also said that contrary to Musk\u2019s previous suggestions that Twitter was in danger of bankruptcy, things had bounced back. \u201cFrom an operating cash flow perspective, we are just about break-even,\u201d she said, and projected that the company would be profitable early next year.\n\nOn Yaccarino\u2019s position in the company and in Musk\u2019s eyes: She said that she and Musk \u201ctalk about everything,\u201d including his recently floated plan to convert Twitter from a free service to one that would require all users to pay, and that it was only right for him to tweet the way he\u2019d like. \u201cThe foundation of X is based on free expression and freedom of speech,\u201d Yaccarino explained. \u201cEveryone has the opportunity to speak their opinion. Including Elon.\u201d\n\n\nYaccarino also dismissed the idea that her power was diminished by Musk\u2019s control of the tech company\u2019s product. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want Elon Musk sitting by their side running product?\u201d she asked the audience.\n\nAnd in reference to Musk\u2019s erratic nature and tendency to slip into \u201cdemon mode\u201d \u2014 a phrase that surfaced in the new Musk biography by Walter Isaacson \u2014 she said she has yet to see that. \u201cWhen you get inspired and pushed by Elon Musk, you do the things that you\u2019d think were never normally possible,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been there 12 weeks. I am still somewhat in awe of his availability to me.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter prior to Musk\u2019s ownership: Yaccarino, like Musk, said that while she liked Twitter and had previously partnered with the company when she ran advertising at NBCUniversal, it was a deeply flawed company. \u201cTwitter at the time was operating on a different set of rules ... different philosophies and different ideologies, [it was] creeping down the road of censorship,\u201d she said. Musk\u2019s new company, she repeated a few times, \u201cis a new company, building a foundation based on free expression and free speech.\u201d\n\nAgain, you\u2019ll want to watch the video above for this one. It\u2019s quite something.\n\nDoes any of this matter when it comes to the future of Twitter under Musk, and Yaccarino\u2019s tenure there? There\u2019s no way of knowing. Yaccarino has deep ties with the advertising business, and there are still many people in the industry hoping she can return Twitter to something they can spend (some) money on. Maybe that will happen. Note, for example, this recent public hug from the head of the NFL\u2019s media operation, a very important Twitter partner:\n\n\nBut watching Yaccarino\u2019s appearance onstage also reminded me of the Trump administration, when members of Trump\u2019s circle would go on TV knowing that their primary mission was to please the president, who was famously glued to TV news. If Elon Musk sees Wednesday\u2019s event, he\u2019ll see, at a minimum, that his CEO is happy to share her displeasure with a media company in a public forum. Maybe he\u2019ll like that? It appears you've shared a lengthy article or text related to an interview with a Twitter executive, discussing various aspects of Twitter under Elon Musk's ownership. If you have any specific questions or topics you'd like to discuss or if there's a particular aspect of this article you'd like to focus on, please let me know, and I'll be happy to provide information or engage in a discussion related to it. talk about it   [/INST] Certainly, let's discuss some key points from the article about Twitter under Elon Musk's ownership and the perspective of the Twitter executive, Linda Yaccarino:\n\n1. **Twitter's User Base**: According to Yaccarino, Twitter has experienced significant growth in its user base since Elon Musk's acquisition. She claimed that the company now has more than 540 million users, which is more than double the figure Musk cited last November. This suggests that Twitter's user engagement and reach have expanded.\n\n2. **Financial Status**: Contrary to Musk's previous comments about declining advertising revenue, Yaccarino mentioned that advertisers, both large and small, are returning to Twitter. She attributed this return to the platform's power and significance. She also stated that Twitter's financial situation had improved, with a projection of profitability in the near future.\n\n3. **Leadership and Decision-Making**: Yaccarino explained that she and Elon Musk have open communication and discuss various aspects of Twitter's direction, including Musk's idea of converting Twitter into a paid platform. She emphasized the importance of free expression and freedom of speech as the foundation of Twitter.\n\n4. **Twitter's Past Issues**: Yaccarino acknowledged that Twitter had faced challenges in the past, including issues related to censorship and content moderation. However, she portrayed Musk's Twitter as a \"new company\" focused on building a foundation based on free expression and free speech.\n\n5. **Media Relations**: The article also touches on Yaccarino's appearance at the Code conference and her public exchange with Yoel Roth, the former head of trust and safety at Twitter. This exchange highlights the challenges and controversies associated with Musk's ownership of Twitter.\n\nOverall, the article sheds light on the ongoing changes and challenges within Twitter under Elon Musk's leadership, with Linda Yaccarino playing a central role in shaping the company's future direction. It remains to be seen how these developments will impact Twitter's user base, financial performance, and its role in the broader social media landscape. <s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] HBM Inner Loop\nV: N X d\nCopy 10\n5 0\nAttention on GPT-2\nFlashAttention\nOuter Loop\nFlashAttention\nFigure 1: Left: FlashAttention uses tiling to prevent materialization of the large \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 attention matrix (dotted box) on (relatively) slow GPU HBM. In the outer loop (red arrows), FlashAttention loops through blocks of the K and V matrices and loads them to fast on-chip SRAM. In each block, FlashAttention loops over blocks of Q matrix (blue arrows), loading them to SRAM, and writing the output of the attention\ncomputation back to HBM. Right: Speedup over the PyTorch implementation of attention on GPT-2. FlashAttention does not read and write the large \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 attention matrix to HBM, resulting in an 7.6\u00d7 speedup on the attention computation.\nGPUs, compute speed has out-paced memory speed [61, 62, 63], and most operations in Transformers are bottlenecked by memory accesses [43]. IO-aware algorithms have been critical for similar memory-bound operations, when reading and writing data can account for a large portion of the runtime\u2014such as database joins [71], image processing [70], numerical linear algebra [4], and more [40, 85]. However, common Python interfaces to deep learning such as PyTorch and Tensorflow do not allow fine-grained control of memory access.\nWe propose FlashAttention, a new attention algorithm that computes exact attention with far fewer memory accesses. Our main goal is to avoid reading and writing the attention matrix to and from HBM. This requires (i) computing the softmax reduction without access to the whole input (ii) not storing the large intermediate attention matrix for the backward pass. We apply two well-established techniques to address these challenges. (i) We restructure the attention computation to split the input into blocks and make several passes over input blocks, thus incrementally performing the softmax reduction (also known as tiling). (ii) We store the softmax normalization factor from the forward pass to quickly recompute attention on-chip in the backward pass, which is faster than the standard approach of reading the intermediate attention matrix from HBM. We implement FlashAttention in CUDA to achieve fine-grained control over memory access and fuse all the attention operations into one GPU kernel. Even with the increased FLOPs due to recomputation, our algorithm both runs faster (up to 7.6x on GPT-2 [67], Figure 1 right) and uses less memory\u2014linear in sequence length\u2014than standard attention, thanks to the massively reduced amount of HBM access.\nWe analyze the IO complexity [1] of FlashAttention, proving that it requires \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc412\ud835\udc512\ud835\udc40\u22121) HBM accesses where \ud835\udc51 is the head dimension and \ud835\udc40 is the size of SRAM, as compared to \u03a9(\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udc412) of standard attention. For typical values of \ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc40, FlashAttention requires many times fewer HBM accesses compared to standard attention (up to 9\u00d7 fewer, as shown in Fig. 2). Moreover, we provide a lower bound, showing that no exact attention algorithm can asymptotically improve on the number of HBM accesses over all SRAM sizes.\nWe also show that FlashAttention can serve as a useful primitive for realizing the potential of approximate attention algorithms by overcoming their issues with memory access overhead. As a proof of concept, we implement block-sparse FlashAttention, a sparse attention algorithm that is 2-4\u00d7 faster than even FlashAttention, scaling up to sequence length of 64k. We prove that block-sparse FlashAttention has better IO complexity than FlashAttention by a factor proportional to the sparsity ratio. We discuss further extensions to other operations (attention on multi-GPU, kernel regression, block-sparse matrix\n2\n    Matmul Dropout\nSoftmax\nFused Mask Kernel\nMatmul\n          Inner Loop\nQKT: N x N\nTime (ms)\n    Outer Loop\nInner Loop\n    \nmultiply) in Section 5. We open-source FlashAttention to make it easier to build on this primitive.1\nWe empirically validate that FlashAttention speeds up model training and improves model quality by modeling longer context. We also benchmark the runtime and memory footprint of FlashAttention and\nblock-sparse FlashAttention compared to prior attention implementations.\n\u2022 Faster Model Training. FlashAttention trains Transformer models faster in wall-clock time. We\ntrain BERT-large (seq. length 512) 15% faster than the training speed record in MLPerf 1.1 [58], GPT2 (seq. length 1K) 3\u00d7 faster than baseline implementations from HuggingFace [87] and Megatron-LM [77],\nand long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K) 2.4\u00d7 faster than baselines.\n\u2022 Higher Quality Models. FlashAttention scales Transformers to longer sequences, which improves their quality and enables new capabilities. We observe a 0.7 improvement in perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift from modeling longer sequences on long-document classification [13]. FlashAttention enables the first Transformer that can achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X [80] challenge, solely from using a longer sequence length (16K). Block-sparse FlashAttention enables a Transformer to scale to even longer sequences (64K), resulting in the first model that can achieve better-than-chance performance on Path-256.\n\u2022 Benchmarking Attention. FlashAttention is up to 3\u00d7 faster than the standard attention implemen- tation across common sequence lengths from 128 to 2K and scales up to 64K. Up to sequence length of 512, FlashAttention is both faster and more memory-efficient than any existing attention method, whereas for sequence length beyond 1K, some approximate attention methods (e.g., Linformer) start to become faster. On the other hand, block-sparse FlashAttention is faster than all existing approximate attention methods that we know of.'\"   [/INST] The passage you provided discusses a research paper titled \"FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness.\" This paper introduces a novel attention algorithm called FlashAttention, which is designed to address the computational and memory challenges faced by Transformers when dealing with long sequences.\n\nHere are the key points from the passage:\n\n1. **Problem with Transformers on Long Sequences**: Transformers, which are widely used in natural language processing and image classification, face computational and memory challenges when processing long sequences. The self-attention mechanism in Transformers has quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to sequence length.\n\n2. **Approximate Attention Methods**: Prior research has explored various approximate attention methods to reduce the computational and memory requirements of attention mechanisms. However, many of these methods did not result in significant speedup in practice.\n\n3. **IO-Aware Attention**: The authors argue that a missing principle in addressing these challenges is making attention algorithms \"IO-aware.\" This means considering the reads and writes between different levels of memory, such as GPU on-chip SRAM and GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM).\n\n4. **FlashAttention**: The paper introduces FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm. It uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads and writes between GPU HBM and GPU on-chip SRAM. This design minimizes the need to read and write the attention matrix to and from HBM.\n\n5. **Performance Improvement**: FlashAttention is shown to outperform existing attention mechanisms in terms of both speed and memory efficiency. It achieves significant speedup in training Transformer models compared to existing baselines, particularly on long sequences.\n\n6. **Applications**: FlashAttention enables Transformer models to process longer sequences, leading to higher model quality and the ability to tackle tasks that require longer context, such as document classification.\n\n7. **Benchmarking**: The paper provides benchmarks demonstrating the performance advantages of FlashAttention compared to standard attention implementations and other approximate attention methods across various sequence lengths.\n\n8. **Open-Source Implementation**: The authors have open-sourced FlashAttention, making it available for others to use and build upon.\n\nIn summary, FlashAttention is an innovative attention algorithm designed to accelerate training and improve the efficiency of Transformer models, particularly when dealing with long sequences. It achieves this by minimizing memory access overhead and optimizing attention computations. <s>"}

Let's break down the key components and techniques used in the algorithm:\n\n1. **GPU Memory Hierarchy**: The algorithm is designed to work on GPUs, which have a memory hierarchy consisting of various types of memory with different sizes and speeds. This hierarchy includes high bandwidth memory (HBM), which is relatively slower but has a larger capacity, and on-chip SRAM, which is much faster but has limited capacity. The algorithm leverages this memory hierarchy to optimize memory access.\n\n2. **Execution Model**: GPUs execute operations in parallel using a massive number of threads, which are organized into kernels. Each kernel loads data from HBM into registers and SRAM, performs computations, and writes results back to HBM. Understanding this execution model is crucial for optimizing memory access.\n\n3. **Compute-Bound vs. Memory-Bound Operations**: Operations in deep learning can be classified as compute-bound or memory-bound. Compute-bound operations are primarily limited by the number of arithmetic operations, while memory-bound operations are limited by the number of memory accesses. The algorithm focuses on optimizing memory-bound operations.\n\n4. **Kernel Fusion**: Kernel fusion is a technique that combines multiple operations applied to the same input into a single operation. It reduces the need to load the input data multiple times from HBM, which can be particularly beneficial for memory-bound operations. The algorithm leverages kernel fusion to improve efficiency.\n\n5. **Standard Attention Implementation**: The algorithm starts by describing the standard attention implementation, which involves computing the attention output (denoted as O) from input sequences Q, K, and V. However, this standard approach materializes large intermediate matrices (S and P) to HBM, resulting in high memory usage and slow performance, especially for large sequences.\n\n6. **FlashAttention**: FlashAttention is introduced as an efficient alternative to the standard attention implementation. It aims to reduce HBM accesses and memory usage. The key techniques used in FlashAttention are tiling and recomputation.\n\n    - **Tiling**: FlashAttention divides input sequences (Q, K, V) into blocks and computes attention separately for each block. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be read from HBM. The softmax function is computed row-wise for each block, and the results are combined to obtain the final attention output.\n\n    - **Recomputation**: FlashAttention avoids storing intermediate values (such as S and P) in HBM for the backward pass. Instead, it stores the output (O) and softmax normalization statistics. During the backward pass, it recomputes the necessary values from blocks of Q, K, and V in SRAM. This approach reduces memory usage and speeds up the backward pass.\n\n7. **Implementation Details**: The algorithm provides details on how FlashAttention is implemented efficiently using a single CUDA kernel. It loads data from HBM, performs computations (including matrix multiplication and softmax), applies masking and dropout, and writes the result back to HBM. This approach minimizes the need for repeated data transfers between HBM and SRAM.\n\n8. **Theorem**: The passage concludes with a theorem that demonstrates the correctness, runtime, and memory requirements of FlashAttention. It states that FlashAttention returns the correct attention output with a specific number of FLOPs (floating-point operations) and minimal additional memory usage beyond the input and output.\n\nIn summary, FlashAttention is an efficient attention algorithm designed to optimize memory usage and reduce HBM accesses, particularly for memory-bound operations in deep learning models like Transformers. It achieves this by using tiling and recomputation techniques while minimizing the need for intermediate data storage in HBM. <s>"}
