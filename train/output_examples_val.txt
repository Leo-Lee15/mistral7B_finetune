<s>[INST] ked Twitter and had previously partnered with the company when she ran advertising at NBCUniversal, it was a deeply flawed company. “Twitter at the time was operating on a different set of rules ... different philosophies and different ideologies, [it was] creeping down the road of censorship,” she said. Musk’s new company, she repeated a few times, “is a new company, building a foundation based on free expression and free speech.”

Again, you’ll want to watch the video above for this one. It’s quite something.

Does any of this matter when it comes to the future of Twitter under Musk, and Yaccarino’s tenure there? There’s no way of knowing. Yaccarino has deep ties with the advertising business, and there are still many people in the industry hoping she can return Twitter to something they can spend (some) money on. Maybe that will happen. Note, for example, this recent public hug from the head of the NFL’s media operation, a very important Twitter partner:


But watching Yaccarino’s appearance onstage also reminded me of the Trump administration, when members of Trump’s circle would go on TV knowing that their primary mission was to please the president, who was famously glued to TV news. If Elon Musk sees Wednesday’s event, he’ll see, at a minimum, that his CEO is happy to share her displeasure with a media company in a public forum. Maybe he’ll like that? Not at Elon Musk, the man who hired her to be the CEO of Twitter, the company he subsequently renamed X. Yaccarino says he’s a brilliant leader who is turning his company into something that has more ambition than “any other company likely on earth.”

Instead, Yaccarino is furious that my colleagues at Vox Media announced a last-minute programming update before her onstage interview at the company’s Code conference: They would also host a session featuring Yoel Roth, the former head of trust and safety at Twitter who resigned shortly after Musk bought the company last year.

In his interview with Code co-founder Kara Swisher, Roth recounted the story of his departure from Twitter — focusing on a tweet Musk wrote that wrongly accused him of pedophilia — and how that forced him to leave his home and fear for his safety.

He also questioned Twitter/X’s claims that hate speech had dramatically declined at the company under Musk’s ownership, and warned Yaccarino that she could one day face Musk’s wrath: “Look at what your boss did to me,” he said, when Swisher asked him to offer advice to Yaccarino. “It happened to me. It happened after he sung my praises publicly.”

Apologies for the long meta-backstory. (While we are at it, I’ll disclose that I conducted two interviews at Code this year but wasn’t involved in any other speaker bookings.) But you need it to understand the set-up for the combative tone Yaccarino brought to the stage. It’s also a little embarrassing for a writer to write this but: You’ll want to watch the video of this to get the whole gestalt. Here you go:


The reason any of this matters is that Yaccarino, a veteran TV advertising executive, long accustomed to making persuasive pitches on behalf of her clients, is now trying to do the same for Musk. But convincing the world that Elon Musk — or at least the version of Elon Musk who owns Twitter — is someone they should invest in, financially, emotionally, and otherwise, is a much different task than getting them to buy NBC’s fall TV line-up. And Wednesday’s appearance suggests just how different that task will be. In Yaccarino’s previous life, for starters, she’s never had to represent someone who is feuding with a Jewish anti-hate group.


On to the substance of the interview: You may be under the impression, in part because of reporting about the company and in part because of Musk’s own commentary on his platform, that since Musk bought Twitter, users and advertisers have fled and that the site has seen a spike in hateful content. You may also believe that, although Musk hired Yaccarino to be CEO of the company — a move he essentially leaked while she was preparing to give a major advertising presentation at NBCUniversal, her last employer, and before she had told NBCU execs about her plans — it’s not a real CEO job because Musk still controls major parts of the company. And also because Musk doesn’t seem capable of restraining himself from tweeting things like his belief that the Anti-Defamation League has a vendetta against him.

None of these things are true, Yaccarino explained to interviewer Julia Boorstin of CNBC at the Code conference. Some excerpts from her interview:

On the health of Twitter’s platform under Musk: She repeated earlier claims that the company now has more than 540 million users — more than double than the user base Musk cited last November. “When you look at the length of time spent, engagement on X, the key metrics are trending very, very positively,” she said.

On Twitter’s financial status: While Musk has previously said more than 60 percent of Twitter’s US advertising had vanished since he bought the company, Yaccarino said large and small advertisers are now returning since she arrived on the job. “Why are they returning? They are returning because of the power and significance of the platform,” she said.

Yaccarino also said that contrary to Musk’s previous suggestions that Twitter was in danger of bankruptcy, things had bounced back. “From an operating cash flow perspective, we are just about break-even,” she said, and projected that the company would be profitable early next year.

On Yaccarino’s position in the company and in Musk’s eyes: She said that she and Musk “talk about everything,” including his recently floated plan to convert Twitter from a free service to one that would require all users to pay, and that it was only right for him to tweet the way he’d like. “The foundation of X is based on free expression and freedom of speech,” Yaccarino explained. “Everyone has the opportunity to speak their opinion. Including Elon.”


Yaccarino also dismissed the idea that her power was diminished by Musk’s control of the tech company’s product. “Who wouldn’t want Elon Musk sitting by their side running product?” she asked the audience.

And in reference to Musk’s erratic nature and tendency to slip into “demon mode” — a phrase that surfaced in the new Musk biography by Walter Isaacson — she said she has yet to see that. “When you get inspired and pushed by Elon Musk, you do the things that you’d think were never normally possible,” she said. “I’ve been there 12 weeks. I am still somewhat in awe of his availability to me.”

On Twitter prior to Musk’s ownership: Yaccarino, like Musk, said that while she liked Twitter and had previously partnered with the company when she ran advertising at NBCUniversal, it was a deeply flawed company. “Twitter at the time was operating on a different set of rules ... different philosophies and different ideologies, [it was] creeping down the road of censorship,” she said. Musk’s new company, she repeated a few times, “is a new company, building a foundation based on free expression and free speech.”

To exploit the parallelism available in modern hardware, we split the computation into chunks at the cost of some additional memory. In the outer loop (lines 54-55), we split the queries in to chunks of constant size, resulting in a linear number of iterations. In each iteration of the outer loop, we call _query_chunk_attention, which itself processes the keys and values in chunks (lines 30-31). The chunks are processed sequentially and each chunk is summarized independently (lines 12 to 19). Assuming a chunk size of √n for the keys and values, we hence obtain √n summaries, giving rise to the O(√n) memory complexity.
After the summaries are computed, they need to be rescaled (lines 33 to 36) along the lines of Section 3, before we return the values divided by the weights (line 40). The result of each iteration of the outer loop is directly written to the output tensor res (line 54), so that no additional memory is consumed across iterations. (A multi-stage summarization approach could achieve O(log n) but would complicate the implementation.)
While a constant chunk size for the queries and a chunk size of √n for the keys and values is optimal for memory consumption, the runtime is also affected by the choice of chunk size in practice, which is heavily affected by the choice of hardware. Ultimately, we have to leave this trade-off to the programmer, and expose the chunk sizes as arguments query_chunk_size and key_chunk_size. In Figure 1 we provide default values for the chunk sizes that lead to minimal runtime impact on TPU, while still providing significant memory savings.
5 Empirical Analysis
  [/INST] The provided code and explanation describe an implementation of a memory-efficient multi-head dot product attention mechanism suitable for modern hardware like TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). The goal is to exploit parallelism while keeping memory usage under control.

Here's a breakdown of how the implementation works:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes some variables and parameters, such as the number of queries (`num_q`), the number of attention heads (`num_heads`), and the features for queries, keys, and values (`q_features`, `k_features`, `v_features`).

2. **Chunk Processing**: To exploit parallelism, the code splits the computation into chunks. This is done for both queries and keys/values. The main idea is to divide the queries into smaller chunks (controlled by `query_chunk_size`) and process them one at a time.

3. **Chunk Scanning for Queries**: An outer loop (lines 54-55) iterates over the query chunks. For each query chunk, it calls `_query_chunk_attention` (lines 30-31) to process that chunk. This is where the attention computation happens.

4. **Chunk Scanning for Keys and Values**: Within `_query_chunk_attention`, keys and values are processed in chunks as well. The code slices the key and value tensors to work with manageable portions. This is crucial for memory efficiency.

5. **Attention Computation**: The core attention computation is done in the `summarize_chunk` function. It calculates attention weights using dot products, applies the softmax operation, and scales values based on these weights. The `exp_weights` are calculated after softmax, and numerical stability techniques are applied to ensure reliable computation.

6. **Rescaling Chunks**: After processing a chunk, the `exp_weights` and values are rescaled based on max values to prevent numerical instability (lines 33-36).

7. **Aggregate Results**: The results from each chunk are aggregated to compute the final output. This is done by summing the chunk values and dividing them by the chunk weights (line 40).

8. **Memory Efficiency**: The code ensures memory efficiency by processing queries, keys, and values in manageable chunks. It also makes use of parallelism to speed up computations.

9. **Customizable Chunk Sizes**: The code allows users to customize the chunk sizes for queries and keys/values using `query_chunk_size` and `key_chunk_size` parameters.

10. **Empirical Analysis**: The code is intended for empirical analysis, likely to compare its performance against traditional self-attention mechanisms, especially in terms of memory consumption and runtime.

Overall, this implementation provides a practical way to perform memory-efficient multi-head attention calculations suitable for modern hardware, such as TPUs. It strikes a balance between memory efficiency, computational speed, and ease of use, allowing researchers and practitioners to experiment with different chunk sizes and configurations to optimize their specific use cases. <s>

**Algorithm: Memory-Efficient Multi-Head Dot Product Attention**

**Input**:
- `query`: Query tensor of shape (num_q, num_heads, q_features).
- `key`: Key tensor of shape (num_kv, num_heads, k_features).
- `value`: Value tensor of shape (num_kv, num_heads, v_features).
- `precision`: Precision level for computation (e.g., floating-point precision).
- `query_chunk_size`: Chunk size for queries.

**Output**:
- Attention scores for the given queries.

**Implementation**:

1. Initialize variables:
   - `num_kv`, `num_heads`, `k_features`, `v_features` from the shapes of key and value tensors.
   - Initialize key chunk size (e.g., `key_chunk_size`), ensuring it does not exceed `num_kv`.

2. Normalize the query tensor:
   - Divide each value in the query tensor by the square root of `k_features`.

3. Process queries in chunks:
   - Divide the queries into smaller chunks of size `query_chunk_size`.
   - For each query chunk, perform the following steps:

   4. Chunk Scanning for Keys and Values:
      - Split key and value tensors into chunks to match the query chunk size.

   5. Attention Computation within `_query_chunk_attention`:
      - Calculate attention weights using dot products between the chunked queries and keys.
      - Apply the softmax operation to the attention weights to get `exp_weights`.
      - Ensure numerical stability during softmax computation.
      - Scale the values based on `exp_weights`.

   6. Rescale Chunks:
      - Apply max-value rescaling to `exp_weights` and values.

   7. Aggregate Results:
      - Summarize the chunked results by summing the chunk values and dividing by chunk weights.

8. Return the final attention scores.

This algorithm efficiently computes multi-head dot product attention, processing queries, keys, and values in chunks to reduce memory consumption and maximize parallelism. The choice of chunk sizes (`query_chunk_size` and `key_chunk_size`) can be customized based on hardware and performance requirements. <s>
