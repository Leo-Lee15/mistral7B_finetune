Yaccarino says he\u2019s a brilliant leader who is turning his company into something that has more ambition than \u201cany other company likely on earth.\u201d\n\nInstead, Yaccarino is furious that my colleagues at Vox Media announced a last-minute programming update before her onstage interview at the company\u2019s Code conference: They would also host a session featuring Yoel Roth, the former head of trust and safety at Twitter who resigned shortly after Musk bought the company last year.\n\nIn his interview with Code co-founder Kara Swisher, Roth recounted the story of his departure from Twitter \u2014 focusing on a tweet Musk wrote that wrongly accused him of pedophilia \u2014 and how that forced him to leave his home and fear for his safety.\n\nHe also questioned Twitter/X\u2019s claims that hate speech had dramatically declined at the company under Musk\u2019s ownership, and warned Yaccarino that she could one day face Musk\u2019s wrath: \u201cLook at what your boss did to me,\u201d he said, when Swisher asked him to offer advice to Yaccarino. \u201cIt happened to me. It happened after he sung my praises publicly.\u201d\n\nApologies for the long meta-backstory. (While we are at it, I\u2019ll disclose that I conducted two interviews at Code this year but wasn\u2019t involved in any other speaker bookings.) But you need it to understand the set-up for the combative tone Yaccarino brought to the stage. It\u2019s also a little embarrassing for a writer to write this but: You\u2019ll want to watch the video of this to get the whole gestalt. Here you go:\n\n\nThe reason any of this matters is that Yaccarino, a veteran TV advertising executive, long accustomed to making persuasive pitches on behalf of her clients, is now trying to do the same for Musk. But convincing the world that Elon Musk \u2014 or at least the version of Elon Musk who owns Twitter \u2014 is someone they should invest in, financially, emotionally, and otherwise, is a much different task than getting them to buy NBC\u2019s fall TV line-up. And Wednesday\u2019s appearance suggests just how different that task will be. In Yaccarino\u2019s previous life, for starters, she\u2019s never had to represent someone who is feuding with a Jewish anti-hate group.\n\n\nOn to the substance of the interview: You may be under the impression, in part because of reporting about the company and in part because of Musk\u2019s own commentary on his platform, that since Musk bought Twitter, users and advertisers have fled and that the site has seen a spike in hateful content. You may also believe that, although Musk hired Yaccarino to be CEO of the company \u2014 a move he essentially leaked while she was preparing to give a major advertising presentation at NBCUniversal, her last employer, and before she had told NBCU execs about her plans \u2014 it\u2019s not a real CEO job because Musk still controls major parts of the company. And also because Musk doesn\u2019t seem capable of restraining himself from tweeting things like his belief that the Anti-Defamation League has a vendetta against him.\n\nNone of these things are true, Yaccarino explained to interviewer Julia Boorstin of CNBC at the Code conference. Some excerpts from her interview:\n\nOn the health of Twitter\u2019s platform under Musk: She repeated earlier claims that the company now has more than 540 million users \u2014 more than double than the user base Musk cited last November. \u201cWhen you look at the length of time spent, engagement on X, the key metrics are trending very, very positively,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Twitter\u2019s financial status: While Musk has previously said more than 60 percent of Twitter\u2019s US advertising had vanished since he bought the company, Yaccarino said large and small advertisers are now returning since she arrived on the job. \u201cWhy are they returning? They are returning because of the power and significance of the platform,\u201d she said.\n\nYaccarino also said that contrary to Musk\u2019s previous suggestions that Twitter was in danger of bankruptcy, things had bounced back. \u201cFrom an operating cash flow perspective, we are just about break-even,\u201d she said, and projected that the company would be profitable early next year.\n\nOn Yaccarino\u2019s position in the company and in Musk\u2019s eyes: She said that she and Musk \u201ctalk about everything,\u201d including his recently floated plan to convert Twitter from a free service to one that would require all users to pay, and that it was only right for him to tweet the way he\u2019d like. \u201cThe foundation of X is based on free expression and freedom of speech,\u201d Yaccarino explained. \u201cEveryone has the opportunity to speak their opinion. Including Elon.\u201d\n\n\nYaccarino also dismissed the idea that her power was diminished by Musk\u2019s control of the tech company\u2019s product. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want Elon Musk sitting by their side running product?\u201d she asked the audience.\n\nAnd in reference to Musk\u2019s erratic nature and tendency to slip into \u201cdemon mode\u201d \u2014 a phrase that surfaced in the new Musk biography by Walter Isaacson \u2014 she said she has yet to see that. \u201cWhen you get inspired and pushed by Elon Musk, you do the things that you\u2019d think were never normally possible,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been there 12 weeks. I am still somewhat in awe of his availability to me.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter prior to Musk\u2019s ownership: Yaccarino, like Musk, said that while she liked Twitter and had previously partnered with the company when she ran advertising at NBCUniversal, it was a deeply flawed company. \u201cTwitter at the time was operating on a different set of rules ... different philosophies and different ideologies, [it was] creeping down the road of censorship,\u201d she said. Musk\u2019s new company, she repeated a few times, \u201cis a new company, building a foundation based on free expression and free speech.\u201d\n\nAgain, you\u2019ll want to watch the video above for this one. It\u2019s quite something.\n\nDoes any of this matter when it comes to the future of Twitter under Musk, and Yaccarino\u2019s tenure there? There\u2019s no way of knowing. Yaccarino has deep ties with the advertising business, and there are still many people in the industry hoping she can return Twitter to something they can spend (some) money on. Maybe that will happen. Note, for example, this recent public hug from the head of the NFL\u2019s media operation, a very important Twitter partner:\n\n\nBut watching Yaccarino\u2019s appearance onstage also reminded me of the Trump administration, when members of Trump\u2019s circle would go on TV knowing that their primary mission was to please the president, who was famously glued to TV news. If Elon Musk sees Wednesday\u2019s event, he\u2019ll see, at a minimum, that his CEO is happy to share her displeasure with a media company in a public forum. Maybe he\u2019ll like that?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "9e4e13ee-2dc5-453d-aaf4-332a5b91b207", "children": ["8a0e9b42-59ca-4a25-b25e-2031ab666b60"]}, "8a0e9b42-59ca-4a25-b25e-2031ab666b60": {"id": "8a0e9b42-59ca-4a25-b25e-2031ab666b60", "message": {"id": "8a0e9b42-59ca-4a25-b25e-2031ab666b60", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1695999661.116807, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It appears you've shared a lengthy article or text related to an interview with a Twitter executive, discussing various aspects of Twitter under Elon Musk's ownership.

She claimed that the company now has more than 540 million users, which is more than double the figure Musk cited last November. This suggests that Twitter's user engagement and reach have expanded.\n\n2. **Financial Status**: Contrary to Musk's previous comments about declining advertising revenue, Yaccarino mentioned that advertisers, both large and small, are returning to Twitter. She attributed this return to the platform's power and significance. She also stated that Twitter's financial situation had improved, with a projection of profitability in the near future.\n\n3. **Leadership and Decision-Making**: Yaccarino explained that she and Elon Musk have open communication and discuss various aspects of Twitter's direction, including Musk's idea of converting Twitter into a paid platform. She emphasized the importance of free expression and freedom of speech as the foundation of Twitter.\n\n4. **Twitter's Past Issues**: Yaccarino acknowledged that Twitter had faced challenges in the past, including issues related to censorship and content moderation. However, she portrayed Musk's Twitter as a \"new company\" focused on building a foundation based on free expression and free speech.\n\n5. **Media Relations**: The article also touches on Yaccarino's appearance at the Code conference and her public exchange with Yoel Roth, the former head of trust and safety at Twitter. This exchange highlights the challenges and controversies associated with Musk's ownership of Twitter.\n\nOverall, the article sheds light on the ongoing changes and challenges within Twitter under Elon Musk's leadership, with Linda Yaccarino playing a central role in shaping the company's future direction. It remains to be seen how these developments will impact Twitter's user base, financial performance, and its role in the broader social media landscape."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "parent_id": "aaa2df21-8fed-4442-a7b6-307e096aa961", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2df21-8fed-4442-a7b6-307e096aa961", "children": ["aaa23da4-a05b-46bc-a6f6-d9fa31fb7801"]}, "aaa23da4-a05b-46bc-a6f6-d9fa31fb7801": {"id": "aaa23da4-a05b-46bc-a6f6-d9fa31fb7801", "message": {"id": "aaa23da4-a05b-46bc-a6f6-d9fa31fb7801", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1695999688.197051, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["what is the new direction "]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "fe466595-7de7-4415-b711-c98f92975700", "children": ["83985086-b08e-495e-8c32-18ab2e3e0859"]}, "83985086-b08e-495e-8c32-18ab2e3e0859": {"id": "83985086-b08e-495e-8c32-18ab2e3e0859", "message": {"id": "83985086-b08e-495e-8c32-18ab2e3e0859", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1695999708.885153, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The article and Linda Yaccarino's comments suggest that under Elon Musk's ownership, Twitter is moving in a new direction characterized by several key elements:\n\n1. **Focus on Free Expression and Free Speech**: Yaccarino emphasized that the foundation of this \"new Twitter\" is built on principles of free expression and freedom of speech.

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO- aware\u2014accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3\u00d7 speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4\u00d7 speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models\n(0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge\n(seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n1 Introduction\nTransformer models [82] have emerged as the most widely used architecture in applications such as natural language processing and image classification. Transformers have grown larger [5] and deeper [83], but equipping them with longer context remains difficult [80], since the self-attention module at their heart has time and memory complexity quadratic in sequence length. An important question is whether making attention faster and more memory-efficient can help Transformer models address their runtime and memory challenges for long sequences.\nMany approximate attention methods have aimed to reduce the compute and memory requirements of attention. These methods range from sparse-approximation [51, 74] to low-rank approximation [12, 50, 84], and their combinations [3, 9, 92]. Although these methods reduce the compute requirements to linear or near-linear in sequence length, many of them do not display wall-clock speedup against standard attention and have not gained wide adoption. One main reason is that they focus on FLOP reduction (which may not correlate with wall-clock speed) and tend to ignore overheads from memory access (IO).\nIn this paper, we argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware [1]\u2014that is, carefully accounting for reads and writes to different levels of fast and slow memory (e.g., between fast GPU on-chip SRAM and relatively slow GPU high bandwidth memory, or HBM [45], Figure 1 left).

In the outer loop (red arrows), FlashAttention loops through blocks of the K and V matrices and loads them to fast on-chip SRAM. In each block, FlashAttention loops over blocks of Q matrix (blue arrows), loading them to SRAM, and writing the output of the attention\ncomputation back to HBM. Right: Speedup over the PyTorch implementation of attention on GPT-2. FlashAttention does not read and write the large \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 attention matrix to HBM, resulting in an 7.6\u00d7 speedup on the attention computation.\nGPUs, compute speed has out-paced memory speed [61, 62, 63], and most operations in Transformers are bottlenecked by memory accesses [43]. IO-aware algorithms have been critical for similar memory-bound operations, when reading and writing data can account for a large portion of the runtime\u2014such as database joins [71], image processing [70], numerical linear algebra [4], and more [40, 85]. However, common Python interfaces to deep learning such as PyTorch and Tensorflow do not allow fine-grained control of memory access.\nWe propose FlashAttention, a new attention algorithm that computes exact attention with far fewer memory accesses. Our main goal is to avoid reading and writing the attention matrix to and from HBM. This requires (i) computing the softmax reduction without access to the whole input (ii) not storing the large intermediate attention matrix for the backward pass. We apply two well-established techniques to address these challenges. (i) We restructure the attention computation to split the input into blocks and make several passes over input blocks, thus incrementally performing the softmax reduction (also known as tiling). (ii) We store the softmax normalization factor from the forward pass to quickly recompute attention on-chip in the backward pass, which is faster than the standard approach of reading the intermediate attention matrix from HBM. We implement FlashAttention in CUDA to achieve fine-grained control over memory access and fuse all the attention operations into one GPU kernel. Even with the increased FLOPs due to recomputation, our algorithm both runs faster (up to 7.6x on GPT-2 [67], Figure 1 right) and uses less memory\u2014linear in sequence length\u2014than standard attention, thanks to the massively reduced amount of HBM access.\nWe analyze the IO complexity [1] of FlashAttention, proving that it requires \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc412\ud835\udc512\ud835\udc40\u22121) HBM accesses where \ud835\udc51 is the head dimension and \ud835\udc40 is the size of SRAM, as compared to \u03a9(\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udc412) of standard attention. For typical values of \ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc40, FlashAttention requires many times fewer HBM accesses compared to standard attention (up to 9\u00d7 fewer, as shown in Fig. 2). Moreover, we provide a lower bound, showing that no exact attention algorithm can asymptotically improve on the number of HBM accesses over all SRAM sizes.\nWe also show that FlashAttention can serve as a useful primitive for realizing the potential of approximate attention algorithms by overcoming their issues with memory access overhead. As a proof of concept, we implement block-sparse FlashAttention, a sparse attention algorithm that is 2-4\u00d7 faster than even FlashAttention, scaling up to sequence length of 64k. We prove that block-sparse FlashAttention has better IO complexity than FlashAttention by a factor proportional to the sparsity ratio. We discuss further extensions to other operations (attention on multi-GPU, kernel regression, block-sparse matrix\n2\n    Matmul Dropout\nSoftmax\nFused Mask Kernel\nMatmul\n          Inner Loop\nQKT: N x N\nTime (ms)\n    Outer Loop\nInner Loop\n    \nmultiply) in Section 5. We open-source FlashAttention to make it easier to build on this primitive.1\nWe empirically validate that FlashAttention speeds up model training and improves model quality by modeling longer context. We also benchmark the runtime and memory footprint of FlashAttention and\nblock-sparse FlashAttention compared to prior attention implementations.\n\u2022 Faster Model Training. FlashAttention trains Transformer models faster in wall-clock time. We\ntrain BERT-large (seq. length 512) 15% faster than the training speed record in MLPerf 1.1 [58], GPT2 (seq. length 1K) 3\u00d7 faster than baseline implementations from HuggingFace [87] and Megatron-LM [77],\nand long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K) 2.4\u00d7 faster than baselines.\n\u2022 Higher Quality Models. FlashAttention scales Transformers to longer sequences, which improves their quality and enables new capabilities. We observe a 0.7 improvement in perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift from modeling longer sequences on long-document classification [13]. FlashAttention enables the first Transformer that can achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X [80] challenge, solely from using a longer sequence length (16K). Block-sparse FlashAttention enables a Transformer to scale to even longer sequences (64K), resulting in the first model that can achieve better-than-chance performance on Path-256.\n\u2022 Benchmarking Attention. FlashAttention is up to 3\u00d7 faster than the standard attention implemen- tation across common sequence lengths from 128 to 2K and scales up to 64K. Up to sequence length of 512, FlashAttention is both faster and more memory-efficient than any existing attention method, whereas for sequence length beyond 1K, some approximate attention methods (e.g., Linformer) start to become faster. On the other hand, block-sparse FlashAttention is faster than all existing approximate attention methods that we know of.'\" "]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "83985086-b08e-495e-8c32-18ab2e3e0859", "children": ["df2ac0b8-5c11-42bb-ba6b-6f0864a8166a"]}, "df2ac0b8-5c11-42bb-ba6b-6f0864a8166a": {"id": "df2ac0b8-5c11-42bb-ba6b-6f0864a8166a", "message": {"id": "df2ac0b8-5c11-42bb-ba6b-6f0864a8166a", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1695999724.139197, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The passage you provided discusses a research paper titled \"FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness.\" This paper introduces a novel attention algorithm called FlashAttention, which is designed to address the computational and memory challenges faced by Transformers when dealing with long sequences.\n\nHere are the key points from the passage:\n\n1. **Problem with Transformers on Long Sequences**: Transformers, which are widely used in natural language processing and image classification, face computational and memory challenges when processing long sequences. The self-attention mechanism in Transformers has quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to sequence length.\n\n2. **Approximate Attention Methods**: Prior research has explored various approximate attention methods to reduce the computational and memory requirements of attention mechanisms. However, many of these methods did not result in significant speedup in practice.\n\n3. **IO-Aware Attention**: The authors argue that a missing principle in addressing these challenges is making attention algorithms \"IO-aware.\" This means considering the reads and writes between different levels of memory, such as GPU on-chip SRAM and GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM).\n\n4. **FlashAttention**: The paper introduces FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm. It uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads and writes between GPU HBM and GPU on-chip SRAM. This design minimizes the need to read and write the attention matrix to and from HBM.\n\n5. **Performance Improvement**: FlashAttention is shown to outperform existing attention mechanisms in terms of both speed and memory efficiency.

Performance on other hardware accelerators are similar [46, 48].\nGPU Memory Hierarchy. The GPU memory hierarchy (Fig. 1 left) comprises multiple forms of memory of different sizes and speeds, with smaller memory being faster. As an example, the A100 GPU has 40-80GB of high bandwidth memory (HBM) with bandwidth 1.5-2.0TB/s and 192KB of on-chip SRAM per each of 108 streaming multiprocessors with bandwidth estimated around 19TB/s [44, 45]. The on-chip SRAM is an order of magnitude faster than HBM but many orders of magnitude smaller in size. As compute has gotten faster relative to memory speed [61, 62, 63], operations are increasingly bottlenecked by memory\n(HBM) accesses. Thus exploiting fast SRAM becomes more important.\nExecution Model. GPUs have a massive number of threads to execute an operation (called a kernel).\nEach kernel loads inputs from HBM to registers and SRAM, computes, then writes outputs to HBM. Performance characteristics. Depending on the balance of computation and memory accesses, op- erations can be classified as either compute-bound or memory-bound. This is commonly measured by the\narithmetic intensity [85], which is the number of arithmetic operations per byte of memory access.\n1. Compute-bound: the time taken by the operation is determined by how many arithmetic operations there are, while time accessing HBM is much smaller. Typical examples are matrix multiply with large inner\ndimension, and convolution with large number of channels.\n2. Memory-bound: the time taken by the operation is determined by the number of memory accesses, while time spent in computation is much smaller. Examples include most other operations: elementwise (e.g., activation, dropout), and reduction (e.g., sum, softmax, batch norm, layer norm).\nKernel fusion. The most common approach to accelerate memory-bound operations is kernel fusion: if there are multiple operations applied to the same input, the input can be loaded once from HBM, instead of multiple times for each operation. Compilers can automatically fuse many elementwise operations [53, 65, 75].\n1FlashAttention code is available at https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention 3\n \nHowever, in the context of model training, the intermediate values still need to be written to HBM to save for the backward pass, reducing the effectiveness of naive kernel fusion.\n2.2 Standard Attention Implementation\nGiven input sequences Q, K, V \u2208 R\ud835\udc41 \u00d7\ud835\udc51 where \ud835\udc41 is the sequence length and \ud835\udc51 is the head dimension, we want to compute the attention output O \u2208 R\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc51:\nS=QK\u22a4 \u2208R\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc41, P=softmax(S)\u2208R\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc41, O=PV\u2208R\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc51,\nwhere softmax is applied row-wise.\nStandard attention implementations materialize the matrices S and P to HBM, which takes \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc412) memory.\nOften \ud835\udc41 \u226b \ud835\udc51 (e.g., for GPT2, \ud835\udc41 = 1024 and \ud835\udc51 = 64). We describe the standard attention implementation in Algorithm 0. As some or most of the operations are memory-bound (e.g., softmax), the large number of memory accesses translates to slow wall-clock time.\nThis problem is exacerbated by other elementwise operations applied to the attention matrix, such as masking applied to S or dropout applied to P. As a result, there have been many attempts to fuse several elementwise operations, such as fusing masking with softmax [77].\nIn Section 3.2, we will show that the standard attention implementation performs HBM accesses quadratic in the sequence length \ud835\udc41. We also compare the number of FLOPs and number of HBM accesses of standard attention and of our method (FlashAttention).\nAlgorithm 0 Standard Attention Implementation\nRequire: Matrices Q, K, V \u2208 R\ud835\udc41 \u00d7\ud835\udc51 in HBM.\n1: Load Q, K by blocks from HBM, compute S = QK\u22a4, write S to HBM.\n2: Read S from HBM, compute P = softmax(S), write P to HBM.\n3: Load P and V by blocks from HBM, compute O = PV, write O to HBM. 4: Return O.\n3 FlashAttention: Algorithm, Analysis, and Extensions\nWe show how to compute exact attention with fewer HBM reads/writes and without storing large intermediate matrices for the backward pass. This yields an attention algorithm that is both memory efficient and faster in wall-clock time. We analyze its IO complexity, showing that our method requires much fewer HBM accesses compared to standard attention. We further show that FlashAttention can serve as a useful primitive by extending it to handle block-sparse attention.\nWe focus here on the forward pass for ease of exposition; Appendix B contains details for the backward.\n3.1 An Efficient Attention Algorithm With Tiling and Recomputation\nGiven the inputs Q, K, V \u2208 R\ud835\udc41 \u00d7\ud835\udc51 in HBM, we aim to compute the attention output O \u2208 R\ud835\udc41 \u00d7\ud835\udc51 and write it to HBM. Our goal is to reduce the amount of HBM accesses (to sub-quadratic in \ud835\udc41).\nWe apply two established techniques (tiling, recomputation) to overcome the technical challenge of computing exact attention in sub-quadratic HBM accesses. We describe this in Algorithm 1. The main idea is that we split the inputs Q, K, V into blocks, load them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, then compute the attention output with respect to those blocks. By scaling the output of each block by the right normalization factor before adding them up, we get the correct result at the end.\nTiling. We compute attention by blocks. Softmax couples columns of K, so we decompose the large softmax with scaling [51, 60, 66]. For numerical stability, the softmax of vector \ud835\udc65 \u2208 R\ud835\udc35 is computed as:\n   \u0002 \ud835\udc651\u2212\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65):=max \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65):= \ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc56\n... \ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc35\u2212\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65)\u0003\n\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) , l(\ud835\udc65):= \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc56, softmax(\ud835\udc65):= .\n 4\n\ud835\udc56\nl(\ud835\udc65)\n\nFor vectors \ud835\udc65(1),\ud835\udc65(2) \u2208 R\ud835\udc35, we can decompose the softmax of the concatenated \ud835\udc65 = \u0002\ud835\udc65(1) \ud835\udc65(2)\u0003 \u2208 R2\ud835\udc35 as:\n\u0002 (1) (2) \u0003 (1) (2) h \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65)=\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65 )=max(\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65 ),\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65 )), \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)=\ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65(1) )\u2212\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65)\n(1)\n\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65 ) \ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65(2) )\u2212\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65) (2) i \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65 ),\n\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) l(\ud835\udc65)\n\u0002 (1) (2)\u0003 l(\ud835\udc65)=l( \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65\n)=\ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65(1))\u2212\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65)\nl(\ud835\udc65\n(1)\n)+\ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65(2))\u2212\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65)\nl(\ud835\udc65\n(2)\n),\nsoftmax(\ud835\udc65)=\n.\n Therefore if we keep track of some extra statistics (\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65),l(\ud835\udc65)), we can compute softmax one block at a time.2 We thus split the inputs Q, K, V into blocks (Algorithm 1 line 3), compute the softmax values along with extra statistics (Algorithm 1 line 10), and combine the results (Algorithm 1 line 12).\nRecomputation. One of our goals is to not store \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc412) intermediate values for the backward pass. The backwardpasstypicallyrequiresthematricesS,P\u2208R\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc41 tocomputethegradientswithrespecttoQ,K,V. However, by storing the output O and the softmax normalization statistics (\ud835\udc5a,l), we can recompute the attention matrix S and P easily in the backward pass from blocks of Q, K, V in SRAM. This can be seen as a form of selective gradient checkpointing [10, 34]. While gradient checkpointing has been suggested to reduce the maximum amount of memory required [66], all implementations (that we know off) have to trade speed for memory. In contrast, even with more FLOPs, our recomputation speeds up the backward pass due to reduced HBM accesses (Fig. 2). The full backward pass description is in Appendix B.\nImplementation details: Kernel fusion. Tiling enables us to implement our algorithm in one CUDA kernel, loading input from HBM, performing all the computation steps (matrix multiply, softmax, optionally masking and dropout, matrix multiply), then write the result back to HBM (masking and dropout in Appendix B). This avoids repeatedly reading and writing of inputs and outputs from and to HBM.\nAlgorithm 1 FlashAttention\nRequire: Matrices Q, K, V \u2208 R\ud835\udc41 \u00d7\ud835\udc51 in HBM, on-chip SRAM of size \ud835\udc40.\n1: Setblocksizes\ud835\udc35 =\u0006\ud835\udc40\u0007,\ud835\udc35 =min\u0000\u0006\ud835\udc40\u0007,\ud835\udc51\u0001. \ud835\udc504\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f 4\ud835\udc51\n  2: InitializeO=(0)\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc51 \u2208R\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc51,l=(0)\ud835\udc41 \u2208R\ud835\udc41,\ud835\udc5a=(\u2212\u221e)\ud835\udc41 \u2208R\ud835\udc41 inHBM.\n3: DivideQinto\ud835\udc47 =l\ud835\udc41mblocksQ,...,Q ofsize\ud835\udc35 \u00d7\ud835\udc51each,anddivideK,Vinto\ud835\udc47 =l\ud835\udc41mblocks\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f 1\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc50 K1,...,K\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 and V1,...,V\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50, of size \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc50 \u00d7\ud835\udc51 each.\n4: DivideOinto\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f blocksO\ud835\udc56,...,O\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f ofsize\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f \u00d7\ud835\udc51each,dividelinto\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f blocksl\ud835\udc56,...,l\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f ofsize\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f each, divide \ud835\udc5a into \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f blocks \ud835\udc5a1,...,\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f of size \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f each.\n5: for 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc57 \u2264 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 do\n6: Load K\ud835\udc57,V\ud835\udc57 from HBM to on-chip SRAM.\n7: for1\u2264\ud835\udc56\u2264\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f do\n8: Load Q\ud835\udc56,O\ud835\udc56,l\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56 from HBM to on-chip SRAM.\n9: Onchip,computeS\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 =Q\ud835\udc56K\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc57 \u2208R\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f\u00d7\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc50.\n10: On chip, compute \ud835\udc5a \u0303 = rowmax(S ) \u2208 R\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f , P \u0303 = exp(S \u2212 \ud835\udc5a \u0303 ) \u2208 R\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f \u00d7\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc50 (pointwise), l \u0303 = \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\nrowsum(P \u0303\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57) \u2208 R\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f .\n11: Onchip,compute\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56 =max(\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5a \u0303\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57)\u2208R ,l\ud835\udc56 =\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc56 l\ud835\udc56+\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc56 l\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \u2208R .\nnew \u22121 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc5anew\n12: WriteO\ud835\udc56 \u2190diag(l\ud835\udc56 ) (diag(l\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc56\n13: Write l\ud835\udc56 \u2190 lnew, \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56 \u2190 \ud835\udc5anew to HBM. \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\n14: end for\n15: end for\n16: Return O.\nO\ud835\udc56+\ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc5a \u0303\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\u2212\ud835\udc5anew  \u0303\n\ud835\udc56 P\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57V\ud835\udc57)toHBM.\nnew \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f new \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc5anew \ud835\udc5a \u0303\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\u2212\ud835\udc5anew  \u0303 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f\n We show FlashAttention\u2019s correctness, runtime, and memory requirement (proof in Appendix C).

Let's break down the key components and techniques used in the algorithm:\n\n1. **GPU Memory Hierarchy**: The algorithm is designed to work on GPUs, which have a memory hierarchy consisting of various types of memory with different sizes and speeds. This hierarchy includes high bandwidth memory (HBM), which is relatively slower but has a larger capacity, and on-chip SRAM, which is much faster but has limited capacity. The algorithm leverages this memory hierarchy to optimize memory access.\n\n2. **Execution Model**: GPUs execute operations in parallel using a massive number of threads, which are organized into kernels. Each kernel loads data from HBM into registers and SRAM, performs computations, and writes results back to HBM. Understanding this execution model is crucial for optimizing memory access.\n\n3. **Compute-Bound vs. Memory-Bound Operations**: Operations in deep learning can be classified as compute-bound or memory-bound. Compute-bound operations are primarily limited by the number of arithmetic operations, while memory-bound operations are limited by the number of memory accesses. The algorithm focuses on optimizing memory-bound operations.\n\n4. **Kernel Fusion**: Kernel fusion is a technique that combines multiple operations applied to the same input into a single operation. It reduces the need to load the input data multiple times from HBM, which can be particularly beneficial for memory-bound operations. The algorithm leverages kernel fusion to improve efficiency.\n\n5. **Standard Attention Implementation**: The algorithm starts by describing the standard attention implementation, which involves computing the attention output (denoted as O) from input sequences Q, K, and V. However, this standard approach materializes large intermediate matrices (S and P) to HBM, resulting in high memory usage and slow performance, especially for large sequences.\n\n6. **FlashAttention**: FlashAttention is introduced as an efficient alternative to the standard attention implementation. It aims to reduce HBM accesses and memory usage. The key techniques used in FlashAttention are tiling and recomputation.\n\n    - **Tiling**: FlashAttention divides input sequences (Q, K, V) into blocks and computes attention separately for each block. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be read from HBM. The softmax function is computed row-wise for each block, and the results are combined to obtain the final attention output.\n\n    - **Recomputation**: FlashAttention avoids storing intermediate values (such as S and P) in HBM for the backward pass. Instead, it stores the output (O) and softmax normalization statistics. During the backward pass, it recomputes the necessary values from blocks of Q, K, and V in SRAM. This approach reduces memory usage and speeds up the backward pass.\n\n7. **Implementation Details**: The algorithm provides details on how FlashAttention is implemented efficiently using a single CUDA kernel. It loads data from HBM, performs computations (including matrix multiplication and softmax), applies masking and dropout, and writes the result back to HBM. This approach minimizes the need for repeated data transfers between HBM and SRAM.\n\n8. **Theorem**: The passage concludes with a theorem that demonstrates the correctness, runtime, and memory requirements of FlashAttention. It states that FlashAttention returns the correct attention output with a specific number of FLOPs (floating-point operations) and minimal additional memory usage beyond the input and output.\n\nIn summary, FlashAttention is an efficient attention algorithm designed to optimize memory usage and reduce HBM accesses, particularly for memory-bound operations in deep learning models like Transformers. It achieves this by using tiling and recomputation techniques while minimizing the need for intermediate data storage in HBM."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "parent_id": "aaa2f152-6c70-4792-bac6-9bc1249c20ad", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2f152-6c70-4792-bac6-9bc1249c20ad", "children": ["aaa27ff1-ba9f-4083-8969-da9b2a6effa0"]}, "aaa27ff1-ba9f-4083-8969-da9b2a6effa0": {"id": "aaa27ff1-ba9f-4083-8969-da9b2a6effa0", "message": {"id": "aaa27ff1-ba9f-4083-8969-da9b2a6effa0", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1695999782.978502, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["talk about this \"\"We present a very simple algorithm for attention that requires O(1) memory with respect to sequence length and an extension to self-attention that requires O(log n) memory. This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires O(n2) memory. While the time complexity is still O(n2), device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires O(\u221an) memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n1 Introduction\nAttention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) is widely used in modern neural architectures. In particular, it is the heart of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (Devlin et al., 2019), and found wide-spread adoption across several research areas since then.\nGivenaqueryq\u2208Rd andlistsofkeysandvaluesk1,...,kn andv1,...,vn \u2208Rd oflengthn,attentionisdefinedas\nfollows:\nesi X\nsi = dot(q, ki), s\u2032i = Pj esj , attention(q, k, v) = are the softmax of the dot products of the query and the keys.\nThe straight-forward implementation of the attention operation above requires us to first compute and remember si for all i, leading to a O(n) time and memory complexity for each query. Transformers use self-attention, which issues a separate query for each position in the sequence, so the overall time and space complexity is O(n2).\nIn many works the quadratic time and space complexity of self-attention has been used as the motivation for the investigation of variants of the original attention mechanism and architectures with more favorable complex- ity classes (Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021; Zaheer et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021; Child et al., 2019; Tay et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2020). Modern accelerator hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, are often memory constrained for applications in deep learning, while compute is relatively cheap. So the space complexity of transformers is a particular concern, c.f. Kitaev et al. (2020); Roy et al. (2021); Zaheer et al. (2020).\nIn this work, we present new algorithms for attention and self-attention that require only constant memory and loga- rithmic memory, respectively. The basic algorithm is very simple; but it requires a trick to make it numerically feasible (see Section 3).\u221aWe also present an implementation in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), which runs efficiently on TPUs, and requires O( n) memory for self-attention (see Section 4).\nUnlike other works that aim to reduce the memory complexity of attention, the memory-efficient algorithm for atten- tion that we suggest is not an approximation, but computes the same function. We can hence use the memory-efficient\nvis\u2032i.\nThe result of the attention operation for a single query, is hence a weighted sum of the value vectors, where the weights\ni\n   arXiv:2112.05682v3 [cs.LG] 10 Oct 2022\n \nSelf-attention Does Not Need O(n2) Memory A PREPRINT\n algorithm as a drop-in replacement for other attention implementations to save memory. This may allow us to re- consider architecture choices, or scale to new datasets that require longer, dense attention. However, our algorithm still requires O(n2) time complexity for self-attention and O(n) time complexity for single-query attention, and the various efficient, long-context attention mechanisms remain an interesting alternative to (dense) attention.\n2 Algorithm\nFirst, we present the algorithm for the attention operation with Pa single query and extend the algorithm to self-attention at the end of this Section. We observe that the division by j esj can be moved to the very end of the attention\noperation using the distributive law:\n\u2032 si si = dot(q,ki), si = e ,\nP vis\u2032i i\nattention(q,k,v) = P s\u2032 . (1) jj\n After publishing our initial draft, we were made aware that (1) is a rediscovery of the \u201clazy softmax\" method of Jang et al. (2019, equation 4). Unfortunately their paper went in a different direction and did not discuss the memory complexity implications and other innovations we present in the remainder of this paper. For more details see Section 6.\nThis can be computed with constant memory: The memory overhead of this algorithm consists of a vector v\u2217 \u2208 Rd and a scalar s\u2217 \u2208 R, both initialized with 0. Given the query q, keys k1,...,kn and values v1,...,vn, we process the keys and values in sequence. Given a key value pair ki, vi, we compute si = dot(q, ki) and update v\u2217 \u2190 v\u2217 + viesi and s\u2217 \u2190 s\u2217 + esi . After processing all keys and values, we divide v\u2217 to get the final result.\ns\u2217\nThe analysis of space complexity assumes that inputs are given in a particular order: we first read the query, and then a list of pairs of keys and values. If the inputs are provided in a different order, we have to additionally store an index into the sequence, requiring O(log n) memory instead.\nTo extend this algorithm to self-attention, we compute the results to all queries sequentially. This requires just one additional index into the list of queries, giving rise to the O(log n) memory complexity. Note that the operation produces outputs that are linear in the size of the number of queries, i.e., O(n), which is not counted towards the space complexity.\n3 Numerical Stability\nThe formulation of standard attention that we presented in the Introduction, as well as our memory-efficient algorithm, are not numerically stable when using floating point arithmetic, because the softmax exponentiates the scores. For scores \u2265 89 the exponentiation results in inf (for bfloat16 and float32), which will be carried through to the final result of the attention operation. In practice, the softmax is implemented by subtracting the maximum score from all scores. This does not change the result of the softmax, but avoids this numerical problem.\nOur incremental computation of the sum of exponentiated scores (and the values times the scores) does not immedi- ately allow for the same trick, as the maximum may depend on the last score in the sequence. But the subtraction cannot be delayed either, since the scores must be exponentiated before they can be added to the cumulative sum.\nTo resolve this problem, we introduce an additional scalar, which keeps track of the maximum score that the incre- mental algorithm has seen so far, and we renormalize the sums of exponentiated values as needed: We initialize the vector v\u2217 \u2208 Rd and scalar s\u2217 \u2208 R with 0, and m\u2217 with \u2212inf. As before, given a key value pair ki, vi, we compute si = dot(q,ki), but then the algorithm differs slightly from Section 2. We first compute mi = max(m\u2217,si) and update v\u2217 \u2190 v\u2217em\u2217\u2212mi + viesi\u2212mi and s\u2217 \u2190 s\u2217em\u2217\u2212mi + esi\u2212mi and m\u2217 \u2190 mi. After processing all keys and queries, we divide v\u2217 to get the final result.\ns\u2217\n4 An Implementation For TPUs\nIn this section, we provide a version of the algorithm above that exploits the massive parallelism of modern hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs. The naive algorithm above is is not trivial to parallelize for a compiler, as the incremental sum introduces a dependency across all keys and values.\nWe present the entire implementation, including the support for multiple attention heads and memory-efficient differ- entiation in Figure 1. The implementation does not optimize strictly for memory efficiency, but instead aims to strike a balance between simplicity, computational efficiency, and memory requirements.\"\" "]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "bbaab4e7-fd26-4d3d-8bed-ddb903080eab", "children": ["f3998603-5591-4487-929b-2a1e4320bc59"]}, "f3998603-5591-4487-929b-2a1e4320bc59": {"id": "f3998603-5591-4487-929b-2a1e4320bc59", "message": {"id": "f3998603-5591-4487-929b-2a1e4320bc59", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1695999792.161686, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The passage describes a novel algorithm for attention and self-attention in neural networks, particularly in the context of the Transformer architecture used in natural language processing and other research areas.

They are used to weigh and combine information from a sequence of keys and values based on a query.\n\n2. **Memory and Time Complexity**: The standard implementation of attention has a time and memory complexity of O(n^2), where n is the sequence length.

It also notes that there are other efficient attention mechanisms for handling long-context scenarios.\n\nIn summary, the passage introduces a memory-efficient algorithm for attention and self-attention, which has the potential to significantly reduce memory requirements while maintaining the correctness of computations.

In each iteration of the outer loop, we call _query_chunk_attention, which itself processes the keys and values in chunks (lines 30-31). The chunks are processed sequentially and each chunk is summarized independently (lines 12 to 19). Assuming a chunk size of \u221an for the keys and values, we hence obtain \u221an summaries, giving rise to the O(\u221an) memory complexity.\nAfter the summaries are computed, they need to be rescaled (lines 33 to 36) along the lines of Section 3, before we return the values divided by the weights (line 40).
